        "Wheel end maintenance, currently a necessary evil, may soon become as much a part of trucking history as solidly mounted seats and twin stick transmissions.\nFactory supplied wheel ends, containing carefully assembled seals, bearings and adjusting nuts, need no periodic maintenance. \"These unitized and pre-adjusted wheel end systems are similar in appearance to standard wheel end systems,\" according to TMC Recommended Practice RP640. It continues, \"Therefore, it is important to carefully inspect the hubcap, axle shaft end and retaining nut for system identification.\" There should be a label or identification plate stating: \"Warning: Removal Voids Warranty,\" \"Caution: Removal of Long Life Bearings will Void Axle Warranty\" or \"Warning: Do Not Service Hub and Bearing System.\" If there is no label, you have an older design.\nIf you are buying a new truck or selecting between several used ones, try to specify unitized, factory assembled wheel ends. They will save you a great deal of work, and could help prevent accidents.\nMost existing wheel end assemblies are not unitized. They still require periodic servicing and it is absolutely critical that adjustments must be within a specific range. The assemblies contain a seal to hold lubrication in the parts that rotate with the wheel. They consist of two single row, widespread, tapered roller bearing assemblies and an adjusting mechanism, which is a single nut held in place with a cotter pin, a tang-type locking adjustment nut or a spindle washer-type adjustment nut. Each has a method for preventing the nut from backing-off once adjustment is made.\nWhen wheel ends are out of adjustment or seals are not correctly seated, dire consequences result. Leaky wheel seals can allow bearings to run dry. Without proper lubrication bearings can freeze on the axle, score or burn through it. The result will be the wheel assembly separating from the truck. The separation has the potential to cause damage to other vehicles, severe injury or, in far too many cases, death.\nAdjustment nuts that are too tight can squeeze the bearings and prevent their rotation. This too, can score or burn axles, with the same unfortunate result. If the nuts are too loose, wheel wobble could cause irregular tire wear, cocking of the bearings, spindle damage and wheel separation. When bearings or seals are not properly installed, it is almost impossible to get accurate adjustment at the nut. Even if torque readings are correct, dimensions will be off. We're not talking about huge amounts. Tolerance for end-play at the edge of the brake drum is often only .001 inch to .004 inch.\nProblems start when seals and bearings are removed. Seals are manufactured to extremely close tolerances, and care must be taken to install them properly. Installation, according to TMC RP622 (\"Wheel Seal and Bearing Removal, Installation and Maintenance\"), starts with handling and storage.\nUse a crow's foot pry bar to gently remove the old seal from the hub bore. If there is a wear sleeve on the spindle, remove it by striking the face with the round end of a ball peen hammer. Never use a chisel or sharp tool that could damage the spindle. Discard the seal. Never re-use a seal.\nRemove the bearing cup, following the hub manufacturers' procedures. Use a bearing puller if available, or a soft steel pry bar. Do not use hardened tools. If the hub is aluminum, extreme care must be taken not to damage components. Aluminum hubs can be heated to 250 to 300 degrees to expand the hub. Higher temperatures will weaken the material. Do not use a torch, which can heat unevenly and weaken the metal. You can tell if the hub is up to temperature by testing with special temperature-sensitive wax markers. Be careful bringing the heated hub to a press. Press the cup out.\nRemove and clean the bearing with a filtered petroleum distillate solvent. Never use steam or water, because parts will rust very quickly. Dry the bearing using dry compressed air. Do not spin the bearing while drying it.\nNow inspect the bearings. If they show signs of rust or pitting, or if cages are the least bit damaged, replace them with new bearings and discard the damaged ones.\nAll parts that come in contact with the bearing should be thoroughly cleaned with solvent, dipped in clean axle lubricant and placed in protective oilpaper. If none is available, use clean, dry shop towels.\nInstallation is affected by the condition of the hub bore and the spindle, the preparation of the seal, the tools used for installation and the adjustment of end play. Start by making sure surfaces that will contact the new seal are free of rust, scale, old sealant, and any nicks, burrs or roughness that might interfere with a good seal. If scrapers are used, make sure they are softer than the hub material. Use non-metallic tools on aluminum hubs. Make sure there are no sharp edges on the bore entrance. If there are, use an abrasive cloth to remove them, then thoroughly re-clean the entire area. Be sure all old lubricant and any abrasive residue is removed.\nNext, prepare the spindle. Thoroughly clean it with solvent and dry it with a clean shop rag. Remove any foreign material, then use crocus cloth to polish the spindle where it contacts the seal. Clean threads and keyways with a wire brush, to remove contaminants and prevent false torque and adjustment readings. Remove sharp edges. Wipe down the spindle.\nIf the sealing system uses an axle ring or wear sleeve, put a thin coat of non-hardening sealant on the axle shoulder.\nWhen replacing bearings, replace both cup and cone as a matched set. If new bearings are used, do not remove the rust preventive coating before installation. Also, do not remove any protective coating from new seals, if there is any.\nCheck seal manufacturer's instructions regarding lubrication. If needed, use a light film of wheel end lubricant.\nBearing cups should be pressed into ferrous hubs using the proper driver tool, sized for the particular hub. There is no one-size-fits-all tool when replacing bearings. Aluminum hubs should again be oven heated to 250 to 300 degrees. The bearing cup should be coated with a liquid, graphite-based lubricant, such as Lubri-Kote or its equivalent.\nTo seat the bearing cup, use a cup driver of the right size and, with hand pressure, seat the cup squarely against the shoulder. Do not hammer the driver. If the cup is even slightly cocked, you can ruin the hub, the bearing, or both. Repeat with the other bearing cup. Then lubricate both inner and outer cups with axle oil and mate the new bearing cones with their cups.\nAfter installing the bearings and inspecting the bore, spindle and wear ring (if applicable), it's time to install the seal. Tools and procedures vary widely between manufacturers, so you should be sure to follow their instructions and use their tools. Again, installation tools are product specific.\nTo install a hub-mounted seal, place the hub assembly on a flat surface. With the correct tool, adapter and bearing pilot close at hand, pre-lube the seal if necessary, using the same lubricant to be used in the hub. Place the oil seal on the tool, air side on the adapter. Follow manufacturer recommendations for specific insertion procedures. Once squarely in place, drive the seal in using firm hammer strokes. Make sure the inner bearing rotates freely.\nMany seals can be installed without a driver tool. To hand install a seal, lubricate the seal inside and outside diameters and the bore of the hub. Hand press the seal evenly into the bore. You can use a rubber mallet to gently tap the seal into place, only if recommended by the manufacturer. Avoid cocking the seal. Be sure it is evenly seated and bottomed in the bore.\nTo install a spindle-mounted seal, place the seal onto the spindle so it has the \"Oil Side\" marking facing the spindle end. You must have the proper tool to spindle-mount a seal. Use the tool to seat the seal until the tool bottoms out. Rotate the tool and repeat to make sure the seal is properly seated. Pre-lube the inner bearing and insert it on the spindle.\nYou are now ready to re-assemble the hub. Use a new gasket and attach the hubcap to the hub. Torque all fasteners to factory specifications, which may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.\nKeep seals away from electric motors, welders or any other ozone sources. Ultra-violet light from fluorescent fixtures or direct sunlight can also attack the polymer seals.\nStore seals and bearings in a cool, dry place. Do not expose them to extreme dryness or dampness.\nKeep them in original factory packaging until ready to use. Never store them in open bins, exposed to dust and contamination.\nNever hang seals or bearings on hooks or tag them using wire through their inside diameters. The metal will damage the precision surfaces.\nCleanliness is critical. Wash your hands before handling seals or bearings.\nAvoid dropping them. Although not apparent to the eye, internal damage will affect performance. Do not use seals or bearings that have been dropped. Remember, tolerances are below 0.005 inches.",
        "In the past few weeks, senators have been so focused on squabbling over the nomination of Chuck Hagel as secretary of Defense that it seemed like John Brennan would have a relatively easy time being confirmed as director of the CIA. However, following NBC News\u2019s release yesterday of a Justice Department white paper that outlines the administration\u2019s legal justification for conducting drone strikes against Americans suspected of terrorism, Brennan\u2019s nomination is quickly morphing into a showdown over the Obama administration\u2019s drone policy. Now the New York Times has added more fuel to the controversy, revealing that the United States has a secret CIA drone base in Saudi Arabia that\u2019s used to conduct strikes in neighboring Yemen.\nThe Saudi base, which was constructed two years ago, was first used to launch the drones that killed American-born Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki. Though much of the debate has focused on the targeting of U.S. citizens, only four Americans have been killed in U.S. airstrikes in Yemen since 2002. By comparison, at least 24 people have already been killed by U.S. drones in Yemen this year, and since the campaign started more than 3,000 militants and civilians have been killed in strikes in Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia.\nAs the the White House\u2019s chief counterterrorism adviser, Brennan is the main coordinator of the terrorist \u201ckill list\u201d and oversees the drone strikes conducted by both the military and the CIA. Brennan was previously the CIA\u2019s station chief in Saudi Arabia, and urged the Obama administration to take the threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network\u2019s Yemen affiliate, more seriously.\nInterestingly, some journalists have known about the \u201csecret\u201d Saudi base for some time. The Washington Post says it didn\u2019t disclose the location at the administration\u2019s request, but it \u201clearned Tuesday night that another news organization was planning to reveal the location of the base, effectively ending an informal arrangement among several news organizations that had been aware of the location for more than a year.\u201d The Post reports that it\u2019s just one of a \u201cgrowing constellation of drone bases\u201d operated by the U.S. overseas.\nFor years, critics of the drone campaign have been calling on Obama to make good on his pledge to have the \u201cmost transparent administration in history,\u201d and with Brennan\u2019s nomination, now they feel they finally have a bit of leverage. As Senator Ron Wyden, a member of the Intelligence Committee, told the Post, \u201cIf the Congress doesn\u2019t get answers to these questions now, it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get them in the future.\u201d It sounds like Brennan\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday is going to get ugly.",
        "Risks to the world economy remain to the downside and include sharply weaker global growth and a sudden change to expectations regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate path, Societe Generale warned on Tuesday.\nThe French bank also said there was still a 30 percent chance of an economic \"hard landing\" for China, in its quarterly economic outlook.\n\"The potential for policy errors in China is substantial, and all the more so since a new bubble appears to be building in the property market,\" Societe Generale analysts, led by Patrick Legland and Michala Marcussen, said in the report.\n\"The authorities are clearly keen to start recognizing and tackling the mountain of non-performing loans. The approach will be one of trial and error, with the downside risks implied in the name.\"\nA sharper-than-expected deceleration in the world's second-largest economy could reverberate around the world. SocGen termed it a \"black swan\" \u2014 a metaphor for surprise events that severely affect the world.\nThe bank forecasts China's economy will grow by 6.5 percent in this year, in line with consensus estimates.\nSocGen said uncertainty about Europe's political direction was another risk to the world economy. The near-election of a far-right president in Austria this month and the U.K.'s upcoming referendum on leaving the European Union have brought politics in the region into sharper relief.\nThe bank said there was a 40 percent risk that an unexpected political turn in Europe could double the drag from policy uncertainty on economic growth.\n\"With a very busy political agenda lined up for the coming quarters, the risk of an event delivering an unexpected outcome remains high, be it the OMT (outright monetary transactions) judgment from the German Constitutional Court on June 21, the U.K. 'Brexit' referendum on June 23, Spanish election on June 26, Italian referendum in October and heading into 2017, elections in France, Germany, Netherlands and possibly Italy,\" the bank said.\nSocGen sees growth in the 19 euro zone countries averaging 1.6 percent in 2016, in line with consensus estimates.\nIt added that another \"black swan\" for the economy could be a disorderly re-pricing of market expectations of when the Fed will raise rates again.\nMarkets are mulling whether the Fed will raise rates in June or July, but SocGen thinks the next hike will not occur until December. It forecasts the central bank will then raise rates by 25 percentage points three times in 2017.\n\"If the Fed sends too hawkish a message, the risk is that the re-pricing could turn disorderly. On the flip side, too dovish a Fed could see bond markets unnerved by higher inflation readings and an ever tighter labor market,\" SocGen said.\nThe French bank sees ongoing policy divergence between the Fed and other major central banks, with the Bank of Japan seen continuing on its current policy path and the European Central Bank expected to taper quantitative easing between March and December 2017.\nSocGen added that it had \"given up\" on the Bank of England raising rates from the record-low of 0.5 percent and that the U.K. central bank's next move would be a cut in 2019.\nThe French bank added that the risk of a global recession had eased, but that a sharp disappointment to global growth would still pose a major risk to the global economy.\n\"A prolonged negative market response is the most likely mechanism to take a slowdown to outright recession,\" it warned.",
        "Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 call to ban \u201cfracking\u201d advanced Tuesday in the House and Senate as environmentalists argue the proposals don\u2019t go far enough and the petroleum industry fights to allow the controversial drilling technique.\nWith the groups opposing the bills for different reasons, some lawmakers were left explaining their support as the House Agriculture & Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee voted 10-2 to ban \u201chydraulic fracturing\u201d for oil and natural gas (HB 7029). Later, the Senate Innovation, Industry, and Technology Committee narrowly approved a broader version (SB 7064) that includes provisions on drilling in the Everglades.\nThe acidizing technique uses many of the same chemicals as in fracking, but it dissolves rocks with acid instead of fracturing them with pressurized liquid.\nThe narrow definition is not included in the Senate version. But the Senate bill seeks to provide oil-drilling protections for the Everglades. That move is a reaction to an ongoing legal battle over a Broward County landowner\u2019s plan to drill an exploratory oil well on about five acres in the Everglades. The exploratory well would not involve fracking.\nStill, environmentalists remain opposed to the House and Senate proposals and the possibility of allowing the matrix acidizing technique. Environmentalists contend that fracking threatens Florida\u2019s water supplies and can affect agricultural production and cause environmental damage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fracking ban until all forms of fracking are banned,\u201d said Kim Ross, executive director of Rethink Energy Florida.\nGladys Delgadillo, environmental policy specialist for the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, pointed to concerns that the public will feel safe from fracking when the omission of matrix acidizing leaves \u201cwiggle words\u201d that could be used by the petroleum industry to engage in the practice.\nThe Florida Petroleum Council contends that fracking is safe, can boost oil and gas production and helps hold down energy costs for consumers.\nMica, noting most people are unaware that oil production has occurred for decades in Florida, added there is no need for the legislative action as DeSantis could ask the state Department of Environmental Protection to enact a rule change about fracking.\nRep. Rick Roth, R-Loxahatchee, acknowledged being \u201ctroubled\u201d in supporting a bill opposed by the petroleum industry, which he credited for improving the nation\u2019s energy independence and for cleaning the environment by helping move from coal-fired power plants to gas-fired plants.\nBut he said there are concerns from his neighbors about contaminating the state\u2019s water supply, and the bill could help the industry\u2019s public relations.\n\u201cI think this bill does part of that, saying we are concerned in Florida about contaminating our water supply by injecting water down into wells to do the fracturing,\u201d Roth said.\nNo fracking. No drilling. No exploration. On land or offshore. Period.\nWhat we should be doing is drilling offshore & building new refineries & more pipelines.\nI\u2019m for fracking. Not a single person has contracted cancer from it and the water supply has not gotten worse where fracking exists. \"If people say fracking is causing cancer, they don't know what they're talking about,\" University of California at Berkeley scientist Bruce Ames replies, noting that cabbage and broccoli also contain minute portions of chemicals that could technically be called carcinogens. Russia and other OPEC nations are Paying off these environmental groups in the US to stop fracking.\nMost of those places use surface water for drinking water. In places where they use underground aquifers, there has been contamination. Florida users ground water. The state sets on limestone which has caves that carry our drinking water from Georgia all the way to south Florida. Drilling though the aquifer to frack in the underlying limestone is a recipe for disaster. We have enough problems without adding another.\nIt is sad that most people who oppose fracking choose to recklessly include procedures such as acidizing that have been used for more than 100 years due to a lack of knowledge as to what is actually being done, how and why it is done, the amount of products used and the depths of the treatment and the thickness of the producing zone. Unfortunately, politicians sometimes listen to uninformed peoples radical requests without proper study of the facts. To be fair, the Governor should collect and present the facts to all of the voters rather than ban the oil industry in Florida as a cure all. Let it be known I oppose any offshore drilling, I am opposed to the huge multimillion gallons fracking. I suggest that people here study the oilwell completion records of the producing 11,000+ feet wells located south of LaBelle Fl. in the Felda field. An educated plan and agreement between the oil owners and producers and the State of Florida could provide a very equitable solution to get the excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Everglades.\nI know that every form of oil production is dirty. That every form of oil drilling has accidents. That whenever companies are denied one form they'll push past limits to use any form allowed. No drilling in Florida or it's waters is acceptable. Any accident will have serious effects on our aquifer. Florida gets the majority of it's drinking water from the aquifer. The aquifer also pushes fresh water into the gulfand Atlantic Ocean. That contaminated water would have a serious effect on the environment. The US doesn't need the oil. Florida needs it's drinking water and we need the environment for tourists. One accident is too many. We should remember the BP spill. It was safe until it wasn't. Despite having had a small effect on our environment, it devastated tourism. That's our brrad and butter. Why risk billion$ for a few to make millions. No drilling. No fracking. Not now. Not ever.\nKristin, Tina, Holly, Kim, and Gladys, are \"all in\"...(that's scary...). Has Al Gore been advised?\nBan all fracking in Florida and it's waters. What kind of foolish nonsense is it to allow acid to destroy the limestone base Florida sets on, that our aquifer runs through. It's an accident waiting to happen and it could destroy drinking water for huge numbers of our population.",
        "The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation.\nIdeally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security \u2013external or internal \u2013with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy. National Intelligence cannot be competitively patriotic in relation to the Political Executive unless it is driven to a point where it had to confront the elected leadership on the latter's credentials as the guardian of national security.\nHow does one take a judgement call from outside on the ongoing 'conflict' between FBI \u2013which in US performs the counter-intelligence function against threats to national security- and Donald Trump, that kept on escalating even after the latter had been designated as the President-elect? The discordance between the two sprang up when the agency let it be known to the entire world that Putin's Russia had 'interfered' with the electoral system of US with the motive of helping the Republican campaign. FBI allowed the political furore to develop around the issue to a level where it was suggested that those in charge of Trump campaign might be in a clandestine collusion with Russian ambassador and other representatives of Russia in US. The underlying presumption was that the Republican leadership would be vulnerable to undesirable Russian influence in future. It then took only a little stretching by sections of media to elevate the Russian 'interference' in the US election to an 'espionage' operation that, at least indirectly, could be said to have cast aspersions on the Republican candidate himself. In US the chiefs of Intelligence agencies are political appointees and they would be on test, in a crucial moment for the regime such as the Presidential election- for their objectivity.\nTwo aspects of professional import do arise from this entire episode of Russian 'interference' in the US election. The first relates to the fact that the electoral process in a democratic country is an 'open' public event that can be watched by the entire world. If this happens in a country, which is also the only Super Power of the day, it is not surprising that other major powers- friendly or not so friendly- would have a stake in the outcome of an election that could possibly lead to a regime change. In the recent US Presidential election, Russian interest in monitoring the campaign was no doubt aggressive and reportedly involved prying into the party information available at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters through the deniable route of 'hacking'. The act would be an 'unfriendly' one in terms of international relations and would invite repercussions but would it be the same as 'espionage' which by definition is an attempt to get unauthorised access to State secrets protected through security classification? The onus of protecting information lies with the owner and Donald Trump, happy with the thought that what Russians did only cut to his advantage, was, during his campaign, quick to blame it all on the incompetence of the Hillary camp in securing their communications. The suggestion of 'espionage' could stick only if American Intelligence was able to establish that Russians had laid the groundwork for creating 'agents' in the new Presidency, for the future.\nIn any case this would all be in the area of confidentiality for FBI till such time as the agency reached a definite outcome. And this brings in the second point of professional import in the debate on the continuing discord. The universal practice of Intelligence set ups is not to let any counter- intelligence endeavours become public unless they had been taken to an end point. In classical counter-espionage operations 'suspicion' is not the same as guilt. If a premature disclosure about the 'foreign' contact of the Trump campaign carried the odour of 'subversion', it would certainly have the effect of jeopardising the image of integrity and patriotism of its Presidential nominee. The oversight role of Congressional bodies should not be the reason for Intelligence agencies not sticking to the professional basics of confidentiality. The monitoring authorities understand the professional restraints that Intelligence followed in its pursuit of an enquiry.\nTrump in his first meeting with President Putin secured an easy denial from the latter on the issue of 'interference' with the US election and emphasised the need to move forward on the path of mutual cooperation. The Trump-FBI controversy cannot be totally segregated from the issue of foreign policy that US adopted towards Russia as a successor of USSR of the days of Cold War. In these three decades since the dismemberment of USSR as the Super Power leading the Communist world, serious distrust marked the appr oach of the American foreign policy establishment towards Putin. President Obama had imposed sanctions on Russia on the issue of Ukraine. However, Donald Trump, it seems, looks upon Russia as a European power with which US could do business provided the two countries had no direct clash on economy and global security.\nIt is possible that in the backdrop of a growing Chinese aggressiveness both on geo-political and economic fronts and the emergence of Sino-Pak alliance as a strategic pivot for China, the convergence between Trump and Putin is inching forward on the common threat of Islamic terror. This is fine from India's point of view. India has developed a strong strategic partnership with US, Israel and Japan and so long as we have the freedom to bilaterally deal with Russia to the mutual benefit of both sides, there is no issue for us as far as the state of relationship of Donald Trump with Russia was concerned.",

        "After trumpeting the completion of the $882 million West Building addition Thursday, a top McCormick Place official disclosed preliminary plans for another jumbo expansion that could include a 1,500-room hotel located on the block directly north of the newly opened hall.\nThe Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority board on Tuesday is expected to consider exercising its eminent domain powers to condemn the block, clearing the way for a project that would more than double the convention center's on-site hotel offerings, Ted Tetzlaff, chairman of the board, said in an interview. Other elements could include more parking for McCormick Place, restaurants and other businesses.\nThis bold but risk-laden project would be in addition to the planned 600-room expansion of the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place, an 800-room property owned by the authority, which is known as McPier. The agency is expected to request development proposals for the Hyatt expansion shortly, with a contract likely to be awarded late this year or early next.\n\"Our big customers want big blocks of hotel rooms, some of which need to be at the convention facility,\" Tetzlaff said after ribbon-cutting ceremonies for the West Building. Even with another 1,500 rooms or more on the campus, Chicago still would lag many competitors in terms of on-site hotel availability, he said. Rosemont, for example, has 8,000 rooms near its convention hall, he said.\n\"We believe we're losing business because we can't house people overnight,\" he said in an earlier discussion of hotel needs.\nA manager of one of Chicago's largest trade shows says she thinks the show is losing attendance due to tight hotel supply. \"We use 16,000 rooms on peak, and we could use another 2,000 to 3,000,\" said Mary Pat Heftman, of the National Restaurant Association's annual show at McCormick Place.\nPotential attendees who cannot find rooms \"either don't come or they stay out by the airport,\" she said, \"and I'm confident many are choosing not to come, which limits growth for the city.\"\nThe block in question is bounded by Cermak Road on the south, Prairie Avenue on the east, 21st Street on the north and Indiana Avenue on the west. Part of it is occupied by a bank branch, a parking garage and a brownstone home; part of it is vacant.\nAt least some of the parcel is owned by Maine-based developers Pam Gleichman and Karl Norberg, who last fall had proposed their own mixed use for the property, including 350 residential units, a 200-room hotel and a 475-spot parking garage, according to a posted notice of a zoning change request.\nThey did not respond to requests for comment.\nPulling off a hotel expansion at McCormick Place will be anything but a cakewalk, observers say. South Loop redevelopment is expanding southward rapidly, but the immediate McCormick Place area remains devoid of restaurants, night spots and retail.\n\"Without that, anyone there is basically serving the convention business,\" said Ted Mandigo, a hotel consultant based in Elmhurst. And that is a business with extreme peaks and valleys.\n\"If this project has entertainment, restaurants, food service, retail, something with residential, then they will have created a neighborhood, which will enable the property to serve more than one business source,\" he said.\nMcPier might be better off \"doing infrastructure improvements in the transportation linkages between McCormick Place and the Loop,\" said hospitality industry observer Ace Lanahan, a vice president with Philipsborn Co.\nOthers note that on-campus hotels are becoming de rigueur for convention centers. \"They are competing against other convention centers that have attached hotels,\" said Mark Eble, regional vice president for PKF Consulting.\nAnd the existing Hyatt Regency, despite a feast-or-famine business cycle, is a cash cow for McPier, in part because public financing kept borrowing costs below what they would have been in the private market.\nThe hotel \"averages $18 million to $20 million a year in operating income for us, which is very significant,\" McPier Chief Executive Juan Ochoa said.\n\"Convention centers typically don't make money, that's in all cities, but where we can and do make money is our hotel,\" said John Belcik, chief financial officer.\nMcPier projects that the Hyatt addition and a separate new hotel will swell annual operating income significantly. But the figure will depend on the ultimate scale of a new hotel and on the funding mechanism that is worked out. While the 1,500-room hotel idea is on the table, the authority also is considering a much smaller proposal, to build a new 400-room hotel on the existing campus.\nThe authority is asking the Illinois General Assembly for approval to restructure its debt stemming from previous expansions, including the West Building, because tourism taxes are falling short of debt service needs. The restructuring also would give McPier the ability to issue up to $350 million more in bonds backed by tourism taxes, which could be used to finance expansion of hotel facilities.\nThe Hyatt expansion is expected to cost roughly $145 million, which would leave close to $200 million for a second project.\nIf the legislature nixes the restructuring, McPier would have to borrow at higher rates in the private market and depend on hotel revenue to pay down debt, reducing operating income from the hotels.\nBy expanding on-site hotel offerings, the authority also risks taking business from downtown hotels. \"I've have seen it happen in a number of cases,\" said Heywood Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\nBelcik said the authority does hope to grab more market share, but that slice is more likely to come from hotels in outlying suburbs, which get overflow during conventions.\nAnd, he said, \"We're making it more convenient for our customers.\"",
        "Updated at 3:45 p.m. Thursday: Revised to include that the incidents were sexual assaults.\nAn attack Sunday on a woman walking to her Uptown apartment building is the fourth such incident in the area in the last 14 months, police said.\nEach of the sexual assaults in Oak Lawn and Uptown happened on a Sunday between 12:45 a.m. and 2:30 a.m., and the women, all in their 20s, were grabbed from behind, police said.\nPolice have not said whether the cases are related.\nA detailed description of the attacker is available in only one of the incidents.\nThe first assault occurred about 12:45 a.m. Oct. 2, 2016, as a 27-year-old woman walked in the 3200 block of Fairmount Street. When she got to the entrance of her apartment complex, a man grabbed and assaulted her. He was described as a 5-6 heavy-set Hispanic man with black, slicked-back hair and no facial hair, police said.\nTwo months later on Dec. 4, a 23-year-old woman walking about 1:30 a.m. in the 3000 block of Bookhout Street was assaulted, police said. She screamed for help, and the man fled on foot.\nOn July 23, a 24-year-old woman was walking about 2:30 a.m. in the 2800 block of Bookhout Street toward her apartment complex when a man grabbed her from behind and assaulted her. The woman kicked him off, police said.\nIn Sunday's attack, a man pushed a 23-year-old woman into the stairwell of her apartment complex as she entered the gate and assaulted her, police said. The violence occurred about 2:30 a.m. in the 2800 block of Cole Avenue.\nMAA Apartment Management, which manages a number of Post properties Uptown, said in an email to residents Tuesday that there have been several sexual assaults in the area. It encouraged people to remain aware and to not allow anyone to follow them through vehicle and pedestrian gates.\nDallas police did not indicate whether a weapon was used.\nCrime in Dallas remains at historic lows, but police records show violent crime has risen by 4 percent compared to last year.\nAggravated assaults reported in the city have increased by 11 percent, and reports of sexual assaults have increased by 9 percent compared to last year, police records show.\nAbout 760 sexual assaults and 4,600 aggravated assaults were reported between January 1 and November 30, records show.\nAnyone with information about the incidents in Uptown is asked to call Detective Anderson at 214-671-3616.",
        "LUCKNOW: While pesticide and insecticide toxicity and environmental degradation are causes for growing concern, several alternative cropping practices are being increasingly explored as \u2018healthy\u2019 agricultural practices.\nLUCKNOW: While pesticide and insecticide toxicity and environmental degradation are causes for growing concern, several alternative cropping practices are being increasingly explored as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agricultural practices. Prominent among these, are organic farming, nature farming, angara, rishi krishi, panch kavya, biodynamic farming, etc.\nThe most outstanding aspect of biodynamic farming is that none of the inputs are purchased from outside. According to senior scientist, Dr RA Ram, Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), 500 g of compost developed through a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccow pat pit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 obtained at a marginal cost, is sufficient for an acre of farm land.\nFor a similar sized field, comparatively, 4-5 bags of relatively expensive urea will be required. In addition to this, the soil usually absorbs only 46 per cent of the nitrogen released, and the rest is wasted. Leeching causes the formation of nitrous oxide that has been linked with the destruction of the ozone layer, and nitrates are responsible for the pollution of groundwater.\nA national level symposium on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOrganic farming in horticulture for sustainable production\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was organised by CISH on Friday, and was inaugurated by member agriculture, planning commission, Dr Sompal Shastri. In his inaugural address, Dr Shastri said organic farming is not new to India, as it has been practised by farmers in India for over 10,000 years now.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some believe that organic farming causes a reduction in crop yield, but with modern varieties, mechanisation and better irrigation facilities, this factor too has been negated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he explained.\nDr RK Pathak, director, CISH, said that chemical-based plant protection practices have led to the compaction of soil, low organic matter content in the soil, increase in salinity, sodicity and land submergence, adverse effect on flora and fauna and also a deterioration in the quality of the farm produce.\nIn sharp contrast, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBiodynamic agriculture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 means \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworking with the energies that create and maintain life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Under this system, the energies from the cosmos, earth, the cow and plants, are systematically and synergistically harnessed for enhancing crop production and to establish, maintain and increase the soil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ecosystem.\nExamples of successful farming practices can be seen in mango orchards for the rejuvenation of the trees. A biodynamic tree paste made from mixing cow dung, clay and sand, was used to seal and heal the wounds and for the protection from and control of diseases that are like a plague, wreaking havoc in mango orchards.\nG Kalloo, DDG, ICAR, Delhi, said that there are a number of organic compounds that may be used as parasite predators and used to replace chemical fertilisers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a need to develop technology for the identification and development of bio-agents and also a system for certification, inspection and accreditation of organic crops,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he stressed.",
        "British Prime Minister David Cameron urges parliament to vote to approve British air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria. Rough Cut (no reporter narration).\nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: Prime Minister David Cameron urged parliament to vote on Wednesday (December 2) to approve British air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria after months of wrangling over whether enough opposition Labour lawmakers would back military action. \"The question before the house today, is how we keep the British people safe from the threat posed by ISIL. Let me be clear from the outset, this is not about whether we want to fight terrorism, it is about it is about how best we do that,\" he said at the start of a 10-hour debate due to culminate in a vote at around 2100 GMT. He added: \"The question is this - do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat and do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands from where they are plotting to kill British people, or do we sit back and wait for them?\" However, Cameron faced a possible stiffening of opposition in Labour ranks after media reports he urged his Conservative Party lawmakers at a private meeting late on Tuesday not to vote with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \"and a bunch of terrorist sympathisers\". Many lawmakers demanded Cameron apologise for his remark. Cameron has said he believes British warplanes, which have been bombing Islamic State targets in Iraq for more than a year, should also be tackling the group in Syria rather than \"sub-contract\" national security to other countries. He said that any air strikes on IS in Syria would not increase the likelihood of militant attacks on Britain. \"If there is an attack on the UK in the coming weeks or months, there will be those who try to say it has happened because of our air strikes, I do not believe that will be the case. Daesh have been trying to attack us for the last year, as we know from the seven different plots that our security services have foiled. The terrorist threat level to the UK was raised to severe last August in light of the threat from Daesh, meaning attack is highly likely,\" he said. The November 13 Islamic State attacks that killed 130 people in Paris gave momentum to Cameron's push for air strikes, but critics have questioned whether the action would significantly add to international efforts to defeat the group. Keen to avoid a repeat of a humiliating 2013 parliamentary defeat over plans to bomb the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Cameron had made it clear he would not bring a vote to parliament if he did not think he could win it. That appeared more likely after Corbyn, a veteran anti-war campaigner who says strikes would be ineffective and kill civilians, said on Monday he would allow his lawmakers to vote according to their conscience rather than directing them to follow his lead.",

        "Brien McMahon High School Head Football Coach A.J. Albano during the high School football jamboree at Wilton High School, Saturday morning, Sept. 1, 2012.\nMcMahon head coach AJ Albano can't say for certain that the team's running game is going to be a strength, but if the Senators are going to improve on last year's 3-7 record, Albano strongly believes his Senators need to be able to run the ball.\n\"When you play (FCIAC) teams like New Canaan and Staples and Ridgefield and Greenwich, that are spread football teams and throw it 30, 40, 50 times a game, we have to slow them down,\" said Albano, who has a 9-11 record in two seasons. \"Easier said than done, but we have to try to control the ball and play good defense.\"\nAlbano certainly has the experienced personnel to take the air out of the ball.\nSenior running back Kyle Jordan led the ground attack last year with 631 yards rushing and 7 touchdowns, and he'll be rejoined in the backfield by junior Trey Forney (241 yards, 2 touchdowns) and co-captain Danny O'Brien, who also starts at linebacker.\n\"We're going to put a lot on Kyle's shoulders, and he's ready to put the team on his back,\" Albano said. \"Danny O'Brien, this is going to be the first season he's going to be getting starting reps at running back, so he's got to help Kyle to carry that weight.\"\nTheir ability to run the ball will not only keep opposing offenses off the field, it will help alleviate some of the pressure on McMahon's new quarterback, whoever that might be.\nAlbano is looking to replace Damien Vega, the three-year starter who set the program's single-season completion record as a junior. Vega is among eight offensive starters the team needs to replace.\n\"This isn't the NFL where we can resign a free agent to a five-year contract and hold onto him,\" Albano said. \"We graduate seniors every single year, that is a fact of high school football at every high school in America. Did we graduate more than maybe a year before? Yes. But we always are trying to get juniors and sophomores and new starters up to speed. That's our job as coaches. So we are going to go through growing pains.\"\nJunior Matthew Downey and sophomore Trey Newcomb have been battling since last spring to succeed Vega, and both have exhibited the positives and negatives often associated with inexperienced quarterbacks.\n\"Maybe more so than any other position on the field, the speed of the game at the varsity level affects the quarterback so much,\" Albano said. \"Both have been doing good things and both have been making mistakes and trying to speed up their game. They both have pros and cons, and it's our job as a coaching staff to figure out which puts us in the best position to win. I've been very open about this competition since the end of last season, and we're getting ready to make a decision. I haven't had to make a decision yet, so I haven't made a decision. But obviously the clock is ticking.\"\nThe Senators also must reshape their defense following the graduation of eight starters, including defensive lineman Zack O'Connor, cornerback Jamie Restivo and safeties Marc Lugo and Ryan Scott. Albano said the defense will be relying on O'Brien, safety Drew D'Antonio, and junior defensive lineman Brice Muldoon.\nREASON TO SMILE: The Senators still have their top rusher, Kyle Jordan, and their third-best runner, Forney, from last season.\nREASON TO WORRY: Coach AJ Albano said no favorite has emerged at the quarterback position to replace departed three-year starter Damien Vega.\nOUTLOOK: The Senators have a lot of experience in the backfield with Jordan and Forney, and along the offensive line with Medico and Rodriguez. Like their cross-town rivals, Norwalk High School, McMahon lost a huge playmaker at quarterback and will have to rely on their running game to take pressure off their relatively inexperienced quarterbacks.",

        "A school management and a section of residents at a village in Umaria district have accused union minister for textiles Smriti Irani of entering in such a land deal at their village, which deprives them of their right on the land.\nUmaria is more than 500 kilometers east of Bhopal. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve close to the land in dispute attracts a good number of wildlife lovers every year.\nAs per the information reaching here the district administration has found no illegality in the matter so far.\nEarlier, the villagers of Kuchwahi too submitted an application to the SDM concerned in January this year alleging that the traditional route of the village had been blocked by \u2018Smriti Rani\u2019. The passage of the students from Narva Mohalla to the school too had been blocked by her.\nTalking to Hindustan Times deputy sarpanch of Kuchwahi village Shaukhi Lal Singh said, \u201cWe lodged a complaint to the collector Abhishek Singh a couple of months back. He assigned the matter to sub divisional magistrate (SDM) JP Yadav. But when he did nothing we had to lodge a complaint on the CM Helpline\u201d, he said.\nThe revenue department documents available with HT, however, suggest the land adjacent to the school was purchased by one Markaz Hospitality Private Ltd (authorized person Amit Kumra), which the school management and the villagers consider as the firm of SmritiIrani. The company directors as per information obtained from Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website are Amit Kumar and Rohit Kumra.\nAs per the documents Smriti Irani\u2019s husband Zubin Irani also bought about one hectare land at village Bijharia in Manpur tehsil.

Markaz Hospitality Private Limited\u2019s incorporation date as per information obtained through Ministry of Corporate Affairs\u2019 website is May 10, 2016, two months before it purchased the land. Its registered address is 293, Kehar Singh Estate West End Marg Saidulajab, Saket, Delhi South.\nThe district administration is tightlipped over the land issue.\nCollector Umaria Abhishek Singh said he was not aware of any such complaint. However, he would look into it.\nTalking to the Hindustan Times land owner Rakesh Shukla said he had sold the land to \u2018Rani sahiba\u2019. However, there was no illegality in sale of the land. The school principal (Janki Tiwari) had launched a canard against them.\nHis brother Rajesh Shukla, co-owner of the land, spoke in a similar vein. However, he said he had sold his land to one Gupta.

        "Cami Davre won her fourth consecutive title in both the 800 and 1,600, leaving the door open for an even more impressive feat on the second day of the state track meet in La Crosse.\nThe name Cami Davre will forever be associated with La Crosse and Memorial Stadium, where the Whitefish Bay standout has now piled up 10 state championships in her storied distance-running career.\nThere was one last loose end to tie up June 3.\nDavre, who won her fourth consecutive titles in both the 800 and 1,600 runs June 2 in the Division 1 state meet, had never competed in the 3,200 meters at state. Not surprisingly, the University of Michigan recruit handled it with poise, completing the most grueling triple on the books \u2014 the 3,200, 1,600 and 800. Only one other runner in state history has pulled off the feat of winning all three.\nHer time of 10:53.67 was two seconds ahead of Peyton Sippy of Janesville Craig. Davre said seeing her family in the stands made the moment particularly emotional.\n\"Especially my grandparents; they\u2019ve been taking me to national competitions since middle school, and that kind of opened to the door to what track is (to me),\" Davre said. \"Just saying goodbye to this experience, it\u2019s really sad. It\u2019s meant a lot to me.\"\nShe is the fifth girls athlete in state history to finish her career with 10 overall titles. That includes one relay, four 800s, four 1,600s and the 3,200.\n\"I don't really think of myself like that,\" Davre said of her historic achievements. \"It definitely makes me really emotional, I think about all the memories and teammates and everything. It's been such a good experience. It's just so special. I feel in my heart and I'm just really grateful.\"\nDavre went 2:12.07 in the 800 meters, the event where her 2:09.22 from 2015 will remain the state record at least another year. Earlier in the day, her 4:56.76 was good for a fourth and final state title in the 1,600.\nIt's old hat, and yet, Davre said she was nervous.\n\"Especially this year because it is my senior year,\" she said. \"My coaches have been working on always getting better. I just wanted to finish my high school season off really strong. ... This meet meant so much to me. I had to really fight at the end because I knew I had to race the clock at some point, but I'm glad it worked out. My whole family's here, so I really wanted to make them proud.\"\nDavre's attempt at the infamous triple was aided by a schedule change that moved both the 800 and 1,600 to the first day of competition. That freed her up to run the most demanding of the three events by itself on Saturday.\nShe said the pursuit wasn't a sure thing, even with the schedule.\n\"We had a decent 4x8 that would have been fun to be in,\" Davre said. \"I don't know how it would have worked at sectionals; sectionals is really challenging with those three races (in the same day).\"\nA soccer player at heart when she started at Whitefish Bay, Davre said she began her career with the grittiness afforded by her then-preferred sport.\n\"It helped being feisty in races and just going for it,\" she said. \"I definitely matured. And every year I come back, I remind myself that I need to respect the races, because anything can happen. You could trip, be behind the first lap, or someone from the first heat could have a faster time. Respect the runners, because they deserve to be here. I owe it to myself and teammates who always support me. I do it for them so much more than myself.\"\nWith a 5:04 already on the board from the first heat in the 1,600, Davre found herself behind the pace early in her heat of the 1,600.\n\" I think a lot of people expect me to take it (and set the pace), and just being a strategist, I don't like to take it,\" she said. \"I don't like to feel like I'm being chased. At the halfway point, I (said to myself), 'All right, we have to go now.' I saw the time coming down the straightaway and thought, 'OK, we're good.'\"",
        "\u201cPulse\u201d at the Hirshhorn Museum lets visitors contribute to a masterpiece.\nAt Rafael Lozano- \u00adHemmer\u2019s new exhibit, the art comes alive but only if you follow one rule: You must participate. But don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be graded.\nThe exhibit is called \u201cPulse,\u201d and it opened last week at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. It has three installations that create art by collecting visitors\u2019 biometric data. (Biometric data is information that identifies your body. A fingerprint is one example.) \u00adLozano-Hemmer uses electronic sensors to gather a person\u2019s data and project it through lights, screens and water pumps to create art. He said the purpose of this exhibit is to show people that while we have our differences, we all share a heartbeat.\n\u201cWhat I like about this is that the art is fundamentally out of my control,\u201d says Lozano-Hemmer, a Mexican Canadian artist.\n\u201cPulse Index\u201d is the first installation visitors walk into at the Hirshhorn. It is a panoramic view of 10,000 fingerprints that are collected from visitors through a microscope. When a finger is inserted in the microscope, a fingerprint scan will show up on the wall among thousands of others. Each time a scan is taken, it knocks an old one off the wall. More than 100,000 fingerprints have been part of this installation, which has traveled around the world.\n\u201cPulse Tank,\u201d the second part of the installation, uses visitors\u2019 heartbeats to create rippling waves projected onto the walls in a light show. Scientists use ripple tanks to study how waves work.\n\u201cThe light show is unique; it will never repeat the same thing because it is not a video. It\u2019s all generated by amplifying the electrical activity of the heart,\u201d says Lozano-Hemmer.\nLozano-Hemmer was a chemist before he became an artist. When his wife was pregnant with twins, he listened to their hearts through an ultrasound machine at a doctor visit. He asked the doctor to place a monitor on each baby and noticed each beat was different. This inspired him to learn more about how technology and science can be visualized into art.\n\u201cUnder all this work is the desire to see. I would like people to come to the museum with a sense of wonder to visualize data and metrics,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPulse Room\u201d is the last installation. Visitors walk into a room filled with more than 200 flickering lightbulbs. When two metal rods are held with both hands, it records a person\u2019s heartbeat. That recording is transmitted into a flashing lightbulb. The bulb blinks to the rhythm and speed of that heartbeat. The room roars and rumbles with sounds of different beats.\nIn the first few days, the heartbeats were a mix of those from Hirshhorn visitors and those who saw the exhibit this year in Seoul, Korea. But \u201cPulse\u201d continues to evolve. Lozano-Hemmer said he\u2019s excited to see how the unique biometric data from thousands of visitors will collectively turn into a masterpiece.\nWhere: Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Independence Avenue and Seventh Street in Southwest Washington.\nWhen: Through April 28. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nHow does the president travel?

        "What does a Tory eurosceptic look like? Loud chalk-stripe, a flash of red braces and the faintest whiff of a lunch-time gander at the Members\u2019 wine list. Right? Wrong.\nThe economic trauma of the crash of 2008 is demanding that just as Conservative modernisation needs to be rebooted to suit the new Age of Austerity \u2013 with a focus on bold economic reformism to tackle welfare traps, worklessness and failing schools instead of the cultural gesturism of early modernisation \u2013 so too the crisis demands a rebooted euroscepticism. The Tory Party in Parliament has been transformed by the arrival of the Cameron generation: more entrepreneurial, impatient, ambitious and global in our outlook. In our 30s and 40\u2019s, \u2018Thatcher\u2019s children\u2019 have built careers in the world transformed by the reforms of the 80s and the enterprise economics she unleashed to such effect. Today\u2019s Euroscepticism reflects that transformation. Far from the little England xenophobia of UKIP, the new generation of modern Conservative Euro-sceptics are bound by an entrepreneurial frustration at a European project which is too introverted and bureaucratic to win any Global Race.\nAs a co-chair of today\u2019s Fresh Start Conference for EU Reform \u2013 a major gathering in London of over 200 European national and business leaders from across the continent \u2013 I know that todays euroscepticism is fundamentally different to that which haunted the leaders of a previous era. The cultural and political fundamentalism of early Euroscepticism 1.0 \u2013 an implacable rejection of any loss of sovereignty to \u2018Johnny Foreigner\u2019 that might dilute \u2018Britishness\u2019 and a deep suspicion of anything \u2018European\u2019 has been replaced by a much cooler headed debate about the single market and our trading relationship with the fastest emerging markets around the world. Globalisation, the end of the Cold War, the pace of technological innovation and the collapse of the Eurozone has made eurosceptics of us all. As the Eurozone nations reconstitute the Eurozone in the wake of the banking crisis our relationship will change. This is the UK\u2019s opportunity to refashion a non-Eurozone membership which reflects our vision of being \u2018in Europe but not run by Europe\u2019.\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s groundbreaking Bloomberg speech last year reflected this truth and set the tone for the new debate. Though some noisier fringe elements would suggest otherwise, it was a call that has been heeded by Conservatives up and down the country. Against the backstop of a guaranteed 2017 In Out referendum, the hard graft of turning complaints about the EU into a practical Programme for reform has started. Today\u2019s Conference is the first major step in demonstrating the Prime Minister and Conservative Party\u2019s commitment to leading the renegotiation and reform movement. We will only secure renegotiation with the support of other member states in a \u2018grand reform alliance\u2019, and to that we have to build those alliances and share our various wish lists to find common ground.\nEurope is economically fragile. It desperately needs economic growth, trade and investment to create new jobs and businesses. While the US sorted out its banks and begun to return to some form of economic health, the eurozone is mired in a deflationary spiral, unable to quite commit to fiscal union yet powerless to be a force again until it does. Yet, as I point out in my Fresh Report on the EU and UK Science published last week, too often the EU is its own worst enemy. Last year BASF, the multi billion pound agro-chemical major, announced it was disinvesting its agricultural genetics research programme from Germany and moving to the USA because of the increasing hostility to GM in the EU. Rather than welcoming new technologies such as biotechnology, too often the EU stifles them with misguided regulations. Having spent fifteen years creating and financing new businesses in this sector, I know there are huge global markets eager for European life science exports in areas like healthcare and agriculture and renewable energy. At a time when the sclerotic and uncompetitive Eurozone is struggling and needs growth, such needless own goals make no sense.\nThe Prime Minister has done more for the cause of EU reform that any other British Prime Minister since we joined. Including Margaret Thatcher. The easy options of UKIP \u2013 like Labour\u2019s energy price freeze \u2013 grab a headline but fail the test of basic credibility. The work of reforming the EU is long, technical and unglamorous. But it is the only way. There are no short cuts to reforming a European project which has become far too much about political regulation and not enough about how we can make Europe more competitive globally, and attract more investment and trade with the fastest growing emerging markets.\nDon\u2019t believe the headlines. Far from pin-striped brigades in the Parliamentary tea room banging on about Europe, a new practical, global, entrepreneurial euroscepticism is the default mode of the new Conservative generation in Parliament. Sceptical of Brussels\u2019 over-regulation yet practical enough to know that a reformed EU is a cause worth fighting for. The long slog of renegotiation might be stodgier fare than the drama of storming out. But, as we all know, nothing worth doing is ever easy. The Prime Minister is right. We should be ambitious for Europe and work to agree a reform package to make it more entrepreneurial and globally competitive. We may not succeed. But not trying would be a major derogation of our duty, and a potentially huge missed opportunity to unleash the new cycle of global competitiveness, trade and investment in Europe we so badly need after the crash of 2008. Its Euroscepticism, but not as you knew it. It\u2019s a progressive agenda for reforming the EU for an age of austerity and global competitiveness.\nGeorge Freeman MP is member of Parliament for Mid Norfolk and author of the latest Fresh Start and Open Europe Report on \u2018The impact of EU Regulation on UK Life Sciences\u2019.\nNigel Farage and \u2018new Ukip\u2019 are running away from disaffected Tories.

        "Tanya Plibersek, Health Minister and staunch Julia Gillard supporter, provides gives her take on the coming ALP leadership ballot.\nCHRIS UHLMANN, PRESENTER: Joining me is one of Julia Gillard's staunch supporters, Health Minister Tanya Plibersek.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK, HEALTH MINISTER: Hi, Chris.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: You've just heard what Robert McClelland had to say. He's one of a number in your caucus who believes that this party is doomed under Julia Gillard. Under all the available evidence, isn't that correct?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well I think \"doomed\" is very emotive language. I think we have been having a tough time electorally, but certainly the sort of distraction that we've seen over the last few days doesn't help that. I think we've got an excellent record to talk about and we've got a clear vision for the future. And I hope that on Monday, if this ballot goes ahead, that there is a decisive victory and then we can all go back to doing what we went into Parliament to do, which is serve our communities.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: But you can't convince the community that that's what you're doing, that you are a good government. You can't even convince, it would appear, one third of your own caucus and that surely is disastrous.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well, you're picking numbers out of the air, Chris, so I don't think you can just assume numbers here or there. But, the real issue is that we've been talking about ourselves for much too long. I think - I think we need to sort this matter out on Monday. Julia Gillard has said that if she's not successful on Monday, she'll go to the backbench. I think it's very important that we get a clear statement also from Kevin Rudd that if he should not be successful in a ballot on Monday, that he will accept that his caucus colleagues have made a decision and he will work as part of a team to get our message across, get out the fact that we've done phenomenally well coming out of the Global Financial Crisis, get out the fact that we need to keep our economy strong so that we can build a fairer society.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: But you've just seen what Robert McClelland had to say and we've heard what Bruce Hawker had to say last night. It's quite obvious that the Rudd camp believes that if it gets close enough this time, that's just the start. This could go on for months.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: What do you think it would do?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: ... and, most importantly, what it would do to good government in this country, our ability to deliver for the people that we care about. We've got this huge agenda for the future. We've just released the Gonski Report. We want to engage with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In my own area, I've got a dental report coming out next week. We want to do better on dental health care. These are the things that matter for people.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Certainly. And all of that would be trashed though, wouldn't it - all of that would be trashed by a continuing leadership crisis in the Labor Party and that's what's being promised.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: There must not be a continuing leadership crisis. We must sort this out on Monday that. That must be the end of it, because our record is not getting out, our successes are not making an impact on people, and, more importantly, our plans for the future are being lost in these internal discussions, and Labor Party supporters, Labor Party members, members of the labour movement need to hear us talking about what we're going to do, our vision for the future.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Members of the labour movement would be in despair at the moment, wouldn't they? They would think that this generation of Labor politicians may well be ending the long history of the Labor Party.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well I think there'd be very strong support for us sorting this out on Monday and then getting on with governing.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Was Kevin Rudd as damaging and destructive and dysfunctional as everyone now says? And if so, why didn't you say so at the time?\nCHRIS UHLMANN: You were a closer observer than anyone else.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: ... ministry. No, I'm not gonna pass judgment on people. I have plenty of my own personal failings, and what I do every day is get up and go to work and do the best job I can for the people that I care about that I want to serve. And I think a majority of my colleagues feel that way.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Well we have seen a number of cabinet ministers today, the Prime Minister on down, saying that this is the case. Doesn't that show that as a cabinet they were completely supine; they didn't actually speak up when things were going wrong?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well I think what the Prime Minister said very clearly today is that she worked her guts out to try and fix things that she believed needed fixing and she did it inside the cabinet processes, which is completely appropriate. In fact I don't think this sort of public blood-letting does any of us any good. I think it overshadows our great achievements and it overshadows our plans for the future, and really, that's what people wanna hear about.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: With everything that we've heard though over the last little while, and we're going to hear a lot more over the course weekend as people try to bludgeon support one way or the other in caucus, how can you possibly unite after this and convince the people that you have united?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well, I am confident we can. You know, we just heard from Robert McClelland who has - you know, said in his interview that he takes a different position from me. I like and respect Robert and I will have no trouble working with him on Monday afternoon, no matter what the outcome of this is. And I truly believe that the vast majority of my colleagues want what's best for the Australian people, and what's best for the Australian people is that we are able to complete the work that we have done.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Very briefly, could you work in a Kevin Rudd cabinet?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: I've worked with Kevin before, I've served him loyally, but I must say I believe that Julia Gillard delivered - delivered the Minerals Resources Rent Tax, a price on carbon, we've now got education reform, disability insurance scheme. She has delivered complex and difficult reform in a very - extraordinarily difficult parliamentary environment.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Tanya Plibersek, we'll have to leave it there. Thankyou.",
        "In politics, business, advocacy, and media, there are veterans on the American landscape who have the potential to make a big difference in the months ahead. Some of them are well-known; many of them are not (but should be).\nWilliam McNulty is a former Marine infantryman who later transitioned into the intelligence community. In 2010 he assumed a new mission with what would eventually become Team Rubicon, a non-profit disaster relief organization he co-founded with fellow Marine Jake Wood.\nSince then, Team Rubicon has grown considerably. The permanent staff now oversees some 16,000 volunteers who deploy wherever disaster strikes. Late this year, McNulty stepped back from the main organization to focus on an ambitious project to take TR international.\nIn 2015, with McNulty now managing director of Team Rubicon Global, look for greater impact from the five-year-old organization as it expands to support relief efforts worldwide. This franchise approach will model Team Rubicon's successes with American veterans and allow foreign military vets to continue to serve in their communities.\nAnnapolis grad and former Marine Don Faul got to his new job by way of Google and Facebook, a great training track for the task he faces as Pinterest's head of Operations.\nFaul is already making waves with his innovative approach to the site's ad units, substituting the standard way of charging an advertiser per one thousand impressions for a model that charges by the amount visitors actually click on an ad \u2013 a huge benefit for the small businesses that frequent Pinterest. Faul's leadership could make a big difference in Pinterest's performance, and beyond that, in how social media is monetized next year and beyond.\nA day after winning the most contested Senate race in the country -- a race punctuated by ads that showcased her talking about castrating cows -- Maj.

If you haven't used UniteUS.com yet, by the end of 2015 you will have.\nSeth Moulton's reluctant entry into politics was spurred primarily by his experiences as a Marine across four tours during the Iraq War \u2013 a war he didn't believe in. After getting his MBA at Harvard and working for a start-up for a while, he decided to run for Congress as a Democrat in Massachusetts sixth district.\nHe ultimately won the election after unseating a longstanding incumbent during the primary.

Look for bigger impact in 2015 as Murphy continues to find his voice as a host and gains more creative control over program topics.\nPHIL KLAY -- Author of \"Redeployment\"\nThe New Yorker said this about Army vet Phil Klay's debut Redeployment: \"The best literary work thus far written by a veteran of America's recent wars . . . Klay's fiction peels back every pretty falsehood and self-delusion in the encounter between veterans and the people for whom they supposedly fought.\"\nThis year Klay was awarded National Book Award for Fiction -- the first Iraq war veteran do so -- and he was also named a National Book Foundation '5 Under 35\u2032 honoree. Whenever he puts pen to paper going forward, his will be an important and credible voice on behalf of those who served during our most recent wars.\nTom Cotton first came to the attention of conservatives when he wrote The New York Times a nastygram from the Iraq War because of a story the paper published that he believed hazarded the safety of his troops. Since that time he's been shaped into a new breed of veteran politician: an anti-progressive in spite of his Harvard degree, one who's Tea Party-friendly but whose views are shaped as much by reason as ideology.\nA recent Atlantic Monthly article put it this way: \"He unites the factions of the Republican civil war: The establishment loves his background, while the Tea Party loves his ideological purity.\" That combo could be used to good effect \u2013 the kind that actually causes outcomes \u2013 as he continues to represent the people of Arkansas' 4th District next year.\nWhile working toward his undergraduate degree at Georgetown University, former Marine and Afghan War vet T.M. Gibbons-Neff has emerged as a high-impact writer with bylines in vaunted publications like The New York Times andThe Washington Post.\nAs an intern with The Post, Neff landed a significant scoop earlier this year with a story that revealed that Maj. Doug Zembiec, the \"lion of Fallujah\" who was killed in 2007, was actually working for the CIA at the time.\nGibbons-Neff is a guy to watch in that he shows a deft hand by leveraging his warfighting experience while remaining an objective journalist -- a skill few possess who deign to cover the topics surrounding national security.\nTulsi Gabbard deployed to Iraq with the Hawaii Army National Guard in 2004, and eight years later she was elected to represent Hawaii's second congressional district. With a diverse background -- she's just 33, thereby one of just a handful of millennials in the House -- and the first member of the Hindu faith to be elected to Congress. She's also just one of two female combat veterans in office.\n\"I saw in Congress we had fewer veterans serving than had ever served before in our nation's history and you have people making very important decisions about where and when our troops go into battle,\" Gabbard told Yahoo News. As the Obama Administration continues to struggle with how to best counter threats like ISIS, watch how Gabbard leverages her war experience going forward.\nAfter earning his MBA, Navy veteran Todd Connor started to miss military life while working as a consultant, so he approached Chicago-based tech incubator 1871 with the idea of creating an effort dedicated to veterans.\nThe result was \"The Bunker,\" a group of entrepreneurs helping vets avoid the pitfalls of tech start-up life as they struggle to get their businesses off the ground \u2013 sort of like a friendlier version of the TV show \"Shark Tank.\" Connor has a vision of national dominance, and \"The Bunker\" detachments have sprouted up from Boston to Austin to Los Angeles.\nAnu Bhagwati's path to becoming an advocate on behalf of female service members started during her time in the Marine Corps where she weathered myriad examples of sexual harassment and found no quarter within the system designed to protect her and then found no justice when she attempted to go around it.\nShe channeled her frustration and anger into action in the form of the Service Women's Action Network, a nonprofit organization that works to end discrimination, harassment and assault in the military. In short order Bhagwati's clear voice and unflinching approach to SWAN's mission has influenced policies at the VA and legislation on Capitol Hill. Look for her to keep the pressure up into the new year.\nBusiness Insider labeled Owen West as \"the most badass banker on Wall Street\" a couple of years ago, and his efforts since then have done nothing but reinforce that title.\nWest left his lucrative job at Goldman-Sachs three times to serve during the Iraq War. He defines \"Renaissance Man\": Novelist and historian; triathlete, world traveler, and philanthropist. But perhaps most importantly, his day job as the director of Goldman-Sachs' veterans networkunderwrites the impact of that program and ensures this generation of warfighters have a place in the halls of power on the south end of Manhattan.\nDawn Halfaker was serving as a military police officer when she lost her right arm in an ambush in Iraq in 2004. Her employment struggles after being medically retired from the Army motivated her to start Halfaker and Associates, a consultant firm that specializes in government tech solutions.\nShe's built the business with an eye on veteran hiring, and, in turn, used the lessons learned as a board member for the Wounded Warrior Project, specifically with WWP's \"Warriors to Work\" employment program. \"A lot of business leaders say they want to hire veterans, but don't know ultimately how they can bring veterans in and empower them to be successful, given the cultural differences of the military,\" Halfaker told The Huffington Post. Look for her to continue bridging that cultural divide in 2015.\nArmy vet Anthony Noto was named Twitter's CFO this summer after shepherding the social media giant through its IPO, and he'll need to channel the aggressiveness he used as a football player at West Point as the company attempts to, as the Wall Street Journal put it, \"transform its mainstream presence into widespread adoption.\"\nNoto's job this year is to diminish investor skepticism by growing Twitter's user base beyond its already gigantic footprint \u2013 a suitable challenge for a former Ranger who honed his business chops at Goldman-Sachs and the NFL.\nThe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America marked a decade of existence in 2014, and the organization is showing no signs of slowing down going into next year. Under the leadership of the well-networked and media-savvy founder Paul Rieckhoff, IAVA championed the Clay Hunt SAV Act \u2013 legislation designed to combat the veteran suicide rate \u2013 at the end of the year, although the bill's passage was singularly impeded by Sen. Tom Coburn.\nAs military vets continue to take their own lives at a rate of 22 per day, don't expect Rieckhoff to give up on this issue in 2015.\nFormer Army intel officer Guy Filippellini co-founded The Commit Foundation to address what he saw as a fundamental flaw in veteran career transition programs he'd seen: One-size-fits-all approaches are largely ineffective.\nThe Commit Foundation's mission statement is at once lofty and matter-of-fact: \"[The foundation] creates serendipity for veterans by fostering mentorship, extending and growing professional networks, promoting familiar camaraderie, and setting the stage for inspiring moments.\"\nThe foundation's approach is different than most in that it's focused on what Filippellini calls \"small touch high impact efforts,\" which means they focus on small numbers of veterans at a time and give each \"sustained attention.\" The veteran unemployment problem isn't going away next year, but Filippellini's foundation is poised to lessen it.\nSenator John McCain returned to the spotlight at the end of 2014 when the Intelligence Committee's report on CIA enhanced interrogation techniques hit the streets. \"[The CIA] stained our national honor, did much harm and little practical good,\" he said on the senate floor.\nMcCain also took over as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee this year, which could be sporty considering his criticism of wasteful spending and his currently rocky relationship with the Pentagon. With his unique ability as a Hill provocateur, 2015 could be an exceptionally bad year for weapons programs that are over budget and behind schedule.\nFormer Army Ranger Robert McDonald took the reins of the VA on the backside of a massive scandal that revealed administrative ineptitude at the agency had led to the deaths of more than 40 veterans.\nMcDonald was brought aboard primarily because of his experience as CEO of Proctor and Gamble, but also because he has more charisma than his predecessor, the phlegmatic Eric Shinseki. McDonald has already been more visible than Shinseki was, threatening to fire large numbers of entrenched bureaucrats and even making his cell phone number public. As more veterans transition to VA care next year, the pressure is on the new secretary to improve the way the agency has performed overall since 9-11.\nThe Aspen Institute's Franklin Project \"envisions a future in which a year of full-time national service -- a service year -- is a cultural expectation, a common opportunity, and a civic rite of passage for every young American,\"according to their website. Jason Mangone is a former Marine Corps infantry officer and the director of the project.\nAlthough he served three tours in Iraq, he is quick to point out that he never saw actual combat and that service is not about that. \"While those who bear the costs of battle carry a heavier burden, the rest of us can still rightly say we've served our country,\" Mangone writes at The Huffington Post. \"Serving my country means that I gave up the normal progression of my life -- high school, college, work -- to do something whose end was civic. The same could be said for the veterans of many other types of national service.\"\nIn an era where the social contract is increasingly challenged by diverging political outlooks, economic circumstances, and cultural backgrounds, Mangone's effort in leading the Franklin Project may ultimately design the road map toward preserving our national identity.\nThough Mat Best did five combat tours to Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom with the 2nd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, he's best known for his collection of hilarious videos on YouTube. He's doing something right: His videos that poke fun at military life have been viewed a whopping 13 million+ times.\nBesides his videos, he's also written on important topics like PTSD. Best is also the founder and president of Article 15 Clothing, a successful business selling everything from t-shirts to patches to branded coffee. While 2014 has been a huge year for the company, next year looks to be even better. Article 15 is launching their own whiskey brand and the team is scheduled to appear in major movies outside of YouTube.\nTim Kennedy is many things: Special Forces sniper, YouTube video star, and philanthropist. As if that weren't enough, his main gig these days is a professional mixed martial arts fighter in the UFC.\nFighting since 2001, the 35-year-old Kennedy now has an 18-5-0 record in the UFC. In 2014, he had two major fights: a dominant win against Michael Bisping, and a controversial loss against Yoel Romero. (Kennedy maintains Romero cheated during the fight by sitting on his stool an extra 30 seconds before the final round).\nLook for Kennedy to continue his rise in the UFC next year. Also keep an eye out for more of his hilarious videos, which are usually put together by Ranger Up.\nMAXIMILIAN URIARTE -- Creator, \"Terminal Lance\"\nIn 2010, then-Marine Lance Cpl. Max Uriarte launched \"Terminal Lance,\" a web comic that captures the grunt-level view of life in the Corps. Drawing on his time in the service -- with two deployments to Iraq -- Uriarte runs a 300,000+ fan-strong Facebook empire that drives readers to his site where he posts two new comics each week.\nNow four years old, the strip has matured into a must-read for military personnel, while also making Uriarte a celebrity among Marines. His Terminal Lance brand helped him fund a successful Kickstarter campaign for a graphic novel he's working on, which brought in more than $160,000. While he works on the novel -- working title \"The White Donkey\" \u2013Max also has plans to move into animation next year.\nJas Boothe was a captain who'd been in the Army for 13 years when she was hit with a double whammy: She found out she had cancer and her home in New Orleans was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.\nThe single mother was suddenly homeless and unemployed. As she fought for her family and her dignity, she discovered there were many other female veterans suffering the same plight. She founded Final Salute to address the problem, and she created the Ms. Vet America event (don't call it a \"pageant\") to bring visibility to the organization.

        "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2014 The last time the New England Patriots faced the Jacksonville Jaguars, Tom Brady completed 26 of 28 passes in a playoff game.\nThat kind of performance by Brady on Sunday should be enough to get the Patriots back into the postseason and, depending on the outcomes of other games, knock the Jaguars out of contention.\nThe Patriots won that divisional playoff game two seasons ago, 31-20. This season, they haven't lost at home and another win would clinch the AFC East after they missed last season's playoffs despite going 11-5.\n\"It doesn't matter what everybody else does,\" coach Bill Belichick said. \"If we win on Sunday, then we've achieved one of our goals this year.\"\nJacksonville needs help from others to have a shot at the playoffs after losing three of four games following a 6-4 start.\n\"They can't be must-wins and you keep losing,\" quarterback David Garrard said. \"They've got to be must-wins and you win one. That time is here and hopefully it happens this weekend, but there are no guarantees.\"\nDenver and Baltimore lead the crowded race for the two AFC wild-card spots at 8-6. Jacksonville is one of six teams at 7-7. The Jaguars missed the playoffs last year with a 5-11 record after getting eliminated the previous season when Brady threw for three touchdowns and two incompletions.\n\"Their defensive identity has changed quite a bit,\" Brady said. \"They have a new coordinator who's brought, definitely, a different style to their defense and they're much more of a blitzing defense.\"\nBrady, whose 2008 season ended with a knee injury in the opener, has played far below his level of 2007, when he threw an NFL-record 50 touchdown passes. In his last two games, he has totals of 307 yards passing with two touchdowns and two interceptions, but the Patriots won both to take a two-game lead in the AFC East with two games left.\n\"Our goals are still ahead of us and we have some great opportunities. Like all of us, I've battled some adversities,\" Brady said. \"A lot of it is being mentally tough and bouncing back from things that don't necessarily go our way and then being able to just continue to respond.\"\nThe Patriots (9-5) have bounced back from three losses in four games. But their latest wins were against two of the NFL's weaker teams, 20-10 over Carolina and 17-10 over Buffalo.\nBrady has been dealing with injuries to his ribs and a finger on his right hand. The running game, behind Laurence Maroney, has been productive, and the young defense has come through after some mediocre performances.\nThe Jaguars could be just the opponent for Brady to regain his old touch. They're last in the NFL with 14 sacks and have three rookie starters on defense, including cornerback Derek Cox. He'll have to stop Brady from completing passes to Randy Moss, who is tied for fifth in the league with 1,144 yards receiving and has 74 catches, 10 for touchdowns.\n\"It's not like I can get away from that,\" Cox said. \"I've seen these guys before on TV. I'm not in awe at all. I'm here to play football.\"\nThese are not the dominant Patriots who went 18-0 before losing the Super Bowl at the end of the 2007 season.\n\"They're finding ways to win without blowing teams out,\" Jaguars cornerback Rashean Mathis said. \"We commend them on that effort, but we can't think in our head that we're playing the 'championship Patriots.' We're playing the Patriots of '09, and that's how you look at it.\n\"If you give a team too much respect, you're going to get your doors blown off. You can't allow yourself to think that way and be successful.\"\nGarrard threw for three touchdowns in his last game, a 35-31 loss, but a late interception ruined the Jaguars' chances of ending Indianapolis' unbeaten season.\nHe's been knocked down more than any quarterback, but is a threat running with 273 yards on 68 attempts.\n\"You've just got to really be disciplined in your rush lanes,\" Patriots defensive end Jarvis Green said. \"He's very dangerous.\"\nNot nearly as dangerous as Maurice Jones-Drew, the NFL leader with 16 touchdowns and third with 1,246 yards rushing. He became the featured running back when the Jaguars released Fred Taylor after last season. Taylor signed with the Patriots and missed the last 10 games with an ankle injury, but participated fully in his first practice for Sunday's matchup.\n\"I think the organization felt great about the contributions he made here for the time that he was here,\" Jacksonville coach Jack Del Rio said, \"but it was time for more of Maurice, so that's what we elected to do. And he's delivered and had a great year for us.\"\nJones-Drew's work will be tougher if nose tackle Vince Wilfork, who missed last Sunday's game with a foot injury, and defensive end Ty Warren, who sat out with an ankle injury, return to their starting spots. Both resumed practicing Wednesday.\nThe last time the Jaguars and Patriots played, Wilfork and Warren each had six tackles and Warren sacked Garrard in the playoff win at New England.\n\"It gave us even more experience,\" Garrard said, \"especially when the game's on the line and (with) a playoff atmosphere and playoffs, period, just being able to battle with some of the greats in this league. They're not invincible, even though they're very good.\n\"We've got a good team, too, so we shouldn't be scared to step up to anybody.\"",
        "As a former Arkansas cowboy who also worked for a company in Florida and married a New Yorker, Lord Thurso is no stranger to the United States.\nToday he returns to his old stomping ground as the chair of VisitScotland at the start of Tartan Week, relishing the opportunity to sell Scotland to the Americans.\nLord Thurso will spend the best part of a week in New York, meeting representatives from Scotland\u2019s biggest overseas market at events to promote Scottish business, hospitality, food, drink and culture.\nFrom the public\u2019s point of view, Tartan Week is best known for the annual Tartan Parade down Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, an event that last year attracted an audience of 30,000 with 3,500 participants taking part.\nToday\u2019s parade will be led by singer/songwriter KT Tunstall, the first woman to lead the parade between 45th and 55th Streets.\nBut it is the more low-key receptions in the city\u2019s skyscraper towers where the real work of Tartan Week takes place.\n\u201cScotland Week is something that the diaspora here in New York invented some 20 years ago,\u201d said Lord Thurso. \u201cIt is a fabulous event. It brings together people who are Scots at heart, Scots who have emigrated here, people whose parents, grandparents and great-grandparents came here and people who just like the idea of Scotland and the wonderful mix that is modern Scotland. That is glorious cultural heritage and the modern innovative Scotland that is creating new industries.\nDespite his many visits to the US, this is the first time Lord Thurso has attended Tartan Week and he will be taking his place in the parade today, sporting his Ancient Sinclair kilt.\n\u201cI will be in my day kilt on Saturday with my bonnet,\u201d he said.\nCritics of the event have suggested Tartan Week, with its element of kitsch, cheapens Scotland\u2019s heritage, but Lord Thurso disagrees. \u201cThis week is something that people in America developed. It is their expression of culture in exactly the same way as the St Patrick\u2019s Day Parade is the Irish expressing themselves in New York. It would be quite rude and insulting if we were to come along and tell them they have it all wrong. However it is done, it is their way of doing it, and I view it as a fantastic opportunity to talk about our great culture and history,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLast night we hosted a reception where we were presenting stories of modern Scotland, of people who have moved their companies\u2019 headquarters to Glasgow in one particular case.",
        "(CNN) - After 8 hours of deliberations Thursday, a St. Louis jury awarded $4.69 billion to 22 women who sued pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson alleging their ovarian cancer was caused by using its powder as a part of their daily feminine hygiene routine.\nThe jury award includes $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages. It's the largest verdict against the company that has sold Baby Powder and Shower to Shower brand talcum powder for decades.\nA jury ruled in Johnson & Johnson's favor in one lawsuit in California last November. In October, a judge reversed two verdicts in favor of the company. A Missouri appeals court tossed out a $55 million verdict in June citing jurisdictional issues.\nIn 2006, the International Agency for Research in Cancer, which falls under the World Health Organization, decided to classify the use of talc in the genital area as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans.\" In the US, government agencies and medical associations that track what causes cancer believe the topic needs more research to know for sure.\nThe US National Toxicology Program, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, keeps a congressionally mandated list of \"agents, substances, mixtures, and exposure circumstances that are known or reasonably anticipated to cause cancer in humans.\" Talc is not among the 248 listed; however, in 2010, when it was up for consideration to be included in the list, the agency explained that it has not fully reviewed talc as a possible carcinogen.\nA separate but related set of lawsuits suggest Johnson & Johnson's powder is contaminated with asbestos. Asbestos, a well-known cancer-causing agent, is often mined near talc. A New Jersey couple was awarded $117 million after after the husband claimed the J&J powder he inhaled gave him mesothelioma, a cancer caused by asbestos exposure.\n\"For over 40 years, Johnson & Johnson has covered up the evidence of asbestos in their products,\" Mark Lanier, lead trial counsel for the women and their families, said in a statement. \"We hope this verdict will get the attention of the J&J board and that it will lead them to better inform the medical community and the public about the connection between asbestos, talc, and ovarian cancer.\"\nDoctors have noticed that talc particles have been in cancer tumors for decades, but it's been unclear how the contamination happened and if it led to the cancer. The women in this case claim to have all used talc based powder for decades to keep their bodies smelling fresh and clean, particularly in their genital area.\nIn a statement following the ruling, Johnson & Johnson said it is confident its \"products do not contain asbestos and do not cause ovarian cancer,\"\n\"Every verdict against Johnson & Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed and the multiple errors present in this trial were worse than those in the prior trials which have been reversed.\"",
        "HOUSTON (CN) \u2013 A Texas death-row inmate who believes chanting prayers with his Buddhist priest as he is executed will help him be reborn in the \u201cPure Land\u201d has asked the Fifth Circuit for a stay because Texas will not let the priest accompany him in the execution room.\nPatrick Henry Murphy, Jr., 57, was serving a 50-year sentence for aggravated sexual assault in December 2000, when he and six other inmates escaped from a prison in Kenedy, Texas.\nNow known as the \u201cTexas Seven,\u201d some of the men held up a sporting goods store in Irving, Texas on Dec. 24, 2000.\nIrving policeman Aubrey Hawkins pulled up to the store and was met with a hail of gunfire. The escaped convicts shot him 11 times, and then ran over his lifeless body as they fled with 44 stolen guns.\nSix of the seven inmates were apprehended the following month after a friend of the owner of an RV park in Colorado saw a spot about them on the TV show \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d and told the owner he believed the men were staying on the property.\nOne of the men shot himself as police moved in. In 2003, a jury convicted Murphy of capital murder for Hawkins\u2019 death and he was sentenced to death.\nMurphy became an adherent of Pure Land Buddhism a decade ago, according to a lawsuit and motion to stay his execution filed Tuesday in Houston federal court.\n\u201cAccordingly, Murphy believes it is possible for him, after death, to be reborn in the Pure Land, a place where he could work towards enlightenment,\u201d the petition states.\nBut Murphy, who is set to die by lethal injection Thursday night, believes he can only be reborn if he can focus on Buddha as the pentobarbital Texas uses to execute prisoners enters his veins and shuts down his organs.\nThrough his attorneys David Dow and Jeff Newberry, professors at the University of Houston Law Center, he asked the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to let his Buddhist spiritual adviser Rev. Hui-Yong Shih be beside him in the death chamber so they could chant prayers as he leaves this world.\nThe TDCJ denied his request because its policy is only its employees can be in the death chamber in Huntsville during executions.\nThe agency only employs Christian and Muslim chaplains and it did not respond to Murphy\u2019s inquiry if it has any Buddhist priests on staff who could accompany him in the execution room.\nMurphy says in his lawsuit he assumes the TDCJ restricts access to the execution room for security reasons, but Rev. Shih poses no risk as he\u2019s been visiting Murphy in prison for the last six years.\nHe claims Texas\u2019 policy violates the First Amendment, which bans Congress from passing laws that prohibit the free exercise of religion, or establish any religion.\nU.S. District Judge Sim Lake denied Murphy\u2019s motion to stay Tuesday afternoon, finding he had waited too long, \u201cuntil the eve of his execution,\u201d to make his case.\nMurphy appealed to the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans on Wednesday morning.\nHis claims mirror arguments a Muslim death-row inmate in Alabama made in January. Domineque Ray, 42, said his execution would be unconstitutional because Alabama would not let his imam into the death room.\nThe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with him, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed in a 5-4 decision.\nThe high court\u2019s majority said Ray had waited too long, just 10 days before his death date, to bring a challenge in federal court. Ray was executed Feb. 7.\nMurphy\u2019s lawyers say the timing of his challenge differentiates his case from Ray\u2019s.\n\u201cMurphy made his request to TDCJ an entire month before his scheduled execution. By doing so, Murphy gave TDCJ more than adequate time to address its interest in assuring his execution is secure,\u201d his stay motion states.\nIf his efforts fail, Murphy will be the fourth U.S. inmate executed in 2019 and the fifth member of the Texas Seven executed by Texas, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\nIts executive director Robert Dunham told the Associated Press in February that U.S. states generally allow spiritual advisers to accompany inmates to the door of the execution room, but not into it.\nA TDCJ spokesman told Courthouse News the agency does not employ any Buddhists who could serve as Murphy\u2019s spiritual adviser in the execution room.",
        "As a funeral was held yesterday for the last of five victims of a fire in a West Baltimore rowhouse last month, a city housing authority memo surfaced, revealing that the home's chief occupant had twice tried to have power restored.\nPanzy Smith, who lived at 912 Amity St., visited the city Crisis Center in the 3900 block of Reisterstown Road in July 1999 and March 2000 for help getting the power restored, a Housing Authority of Baltimore City memo obtained by The Sun indicates.\nAfter the fire, BGE said it had received no calls informing it that those who later died in the fire had moved into the home. Officials also said last month that they had received no calls in the previous six months asking that power be restored.\nBut the Housing Authority memo indicates that Smith, with whom the fire victims were living, had twice sought help in getting power restored.\nThe power had been cut because of an unpaid Baltimore Gas & Electric bill .\nAs a result, the family resorted to using candles, which fire officials believe caused the fatal fire.\nLily-Bell Posley, 53, and her grandchildren, Marquan Williams, 6, Nyjerra McCray, 4, and Shydeim Scott, 2, died on June 10, the day of the fire. The children's mother, Latasha McCray, was not at home at the time of the fire. The grandmother was visiting from Pennsylvania.\nA funeral was held yesterday at the March Funeral Home East on North Avenue for the fire's fifth victim, Dominique Travis Derico, 10, who died Wednesday at Johns Hopkins Hospital from burns suffered in the fire.\nThe deaths produced outrage in the community because the family had been living without electricity for about a year. BGE said it cut power to the Amity Street house last July because of nonpayment of bills and it assumed that the same customer was still living there.\nOfficials said they have since learned that that customer moved. Smith moved into the home last July, and the family moved in with her about four months ago.\nIn a June 15 memo from the city Crisis Center to the Housing Authority, officials said that city officials had contacted BGE in July 1999, shortly after power was terminated, about Smith's account at the Amity Street address. BGE had replied that Smith needed to pay $1,266.59 to have power restored, according to the memo.\nCity officials arranged for Smith to pay $711, with the remaining money coming from the Baltimore Fuel Fund, which helps people in need pay utility bills, the memo said.\nSmith returned to the Crisis Center in March to seek assistance. This time, however, BGE informed city officials she needed $3,784.50 to have the power restored, the memo said.\nThe amount included $2,800 for three other unpaid bills - all under different names and addresses.\nAgain, city officials arranged to obtain $1,649.76 in public funds, leaving Smith with a $1,634 bill. Smith never returned, according to the memo.\n\"We are aware of the family's and Ms. Smith's repeated efforts to restore electricity,\" said William H. Murphy, an attorney retained by Smith and McCray, the children's mother. \"They have retained our services to obtain relief for damages the family suffered during the course of the fire.\"\nBrenda Pettigrew, a BGE spokeswoman, would not comment on a specific account, but said residents are not responsible for bills from previous tenants. Pettigrew said service is restored if the new customer provides documentation that he or she is the new tenant and the old tenant no longer resides there.\nReggie Scriber, an executive director for the Department of Housing and Community Development, said BGE believed Smith had used aliases when establishing previous accounts.",
        "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Despite the drop in President Obama's approval ratings, Republican policies are still not as popular as Democratic policies, according to a new national poll.\nFifty-two percent of people in CNN poll believe Barack Obama's policies will move country in right direction.\nA CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Friday morning indicates the GOP has gained some ground in polls in recent months, but Democrats still hold the advantage on key issues such as the economy and health care.\nFifty-two percent of people questioned say the president's policies will move the country in the right direction. An equal percentage feel the same way about the policies of the Democrats in Congress.\nWhat do Americans think of Republican policies? Forty-three percent say the GOP's policies will move the country in the right direction. Nearly half of those polled said congressional Republicans would move the country in the wrong direction.\nBut the percentage of people who think Obama will move the country in the right direction has dropped 11 points since May, while congressional Democrats have seen a 5 point dip. Congressional Republicans have seen a 4 point rise over the same period.\nPolls in recent weeks have shown Obama's approval rating in the mid-to-low 50s -- a significant drop from early summer, when most polls had his rating at 60 percent or higher.\nCommentary: Did Obama underestimate his critics?\n\"Barack Obama's drop in the polls has not made the Republican Party more popular than the Democrats,\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Still, he adds, \"The GOP may be in a more competitive position -- a comparison with poll results from May suggests that the gap between the parties has been closing.\"\nThe survey suggests that, by 13 points, Americans think the Democrats rather than the Republicans would do a better job handling the economy and Medicare. The Democrats have a 9 point advantage on health care and an 8 point edge on Afghanistan. The two parties are tied on the question of how they'd handle taxes and the federal budget deficit. The GOP holds a clear advantage on just one issue -- terrorism.\nAccording to the poll, six in 10 say that the GOP has not done enough to cooperate with Obama.

        "WHAT was once an \"underground\" garage gym is now a worldwide phenomenon that is now exploding into the Rockhampton fitness scene.\nRockhampton's new CrossFit CQ centre will be holding an inclusive Central Queensland competition this Saturday.\nThe event will welcome CrossFitters from all over Central Queensland, up to Mackay, out to Emerald and Clermont and down to Hervey Bay and Bundaberg.\nAthletes that attend the day will be registered at the centre.\n\"They will receive an athlete pack and will be given an hour to set up, and at 8am we will brief everyone on the day, the workouts and the standards of the workouts and explain the logistics and how the day will be run,\" owner Sean O'Neill said.\n\"From there, everyone will get on board and the workouts will start. There will be 3 workouts for day.\"\nHowever, the day will have an added layer of meaning for the centre, with the theme of inclusiveness the major draw card for the day.\nThe concept of a \"mash up\" will see pairs of athletes being teamed up with another pair from a different gym.\n\"The concept behind that is to get the wider CrossFit community engaging with each other and it's a cool way to meet other people and form relationships and friendship with other CrossFitters from other towns and help people train and reach their goals,\" O'Neill said.\nCrossFit CQ is the dream child of Rockhampton born O'Neill who left behind his career as a Brisbane East Tiger player after developing a taste for the high intensity training.\nAfter discovering CrossFit at his gym, he decided to launch himself into a new field of fitness.\n\"I had an internship in Brisbane over 8 years ago and spent another two at another local CrossFit facility called CrossFit Resolve,\" O'Neill said.\n\"From there me and my business partner --- moved back and started CrossFit Gladstone in Gladstone.\n\"It's been running for six years now and a year ago we trained Tia-Clair Eoomeyand and her coach Shane Orr. We sold that over a year ago.\nMr O'Neill's CrossFit CQ has been in the pipeline quite a long time and has finally come to fruition.\n\"A lot of people are really excited about the opening along with the other businesses in the complex,\" he said.\n\"It's been a talking topic for lot of people for long time and we've all come together this week.\"\nFoot traffic poured through the doors of the Central Queensland Newest Health, Fitness and Well Being Centre on the corner of Kent and Archer St on Monday.\n\"We sent a survey text to everyone who came this week for feedback,\" O'Neill said.\n\"A majority of the responses were they love the site, the premise, and said it's 'so exiting', but they finished by saying 'to be honest, it doesn't matter where you are, as long as the people and the programming and the methodology stays the same.\"\nThe methodology behind CrossFit CQ is what O'Neill is most influenced by and he said at this complex, he and the coaches are \"always using functional movement and varying those\" so it's relate to every individual's fitness level.\n\"Our methodology is about making people better across all ten component of fitness,\" he said.\n\"They range from speed, power to agility, balance, coordination, accuracy, and flexibility. All these things we take very serious and that comes out in our programming.\nAfter becoming a personal training in Brisbane, O'Neill's eye were opened to the complexity of the CrossFit world.\n\"I got to learn a lot early on,\" he said.\n\"I enjoyed and agree with the methodology of the training. It's a very thought out process and an extensive training program.\n\"A lot of people think the high intensity stuff is only done with really fit people, but someone of any fitness level can do it.\"",
        "It is something that comes upon most people at around his age, like realising you'd rather sit on a folding chair at a picnic than lie on a blanket, or being glad you're not going out on a Saturday night. David Cameron wore reading glasses for the first time I have seen at prime minister's questions. I say wore, but helping his ageing eyesight was only one purpose they served.\nOf course they were not any old, off-the-peg chemist's \u00a35.99 glasses, or even something prescribed at Boots. I expect they were the very finest, lightweight lenses sprayed with a magic formula to stop them flashing in the TV lights. They were the type with a wider frame at the top than the bottom, sort of half-timbered glasses, something-or-nothing glasses, which reminded me of the ones worn by Andy Coulson.\nAnd he didn't just pop them on to read from his briefs; he deployed them like a weapon. He waved them in the air to make a point. He banged them down on the dispatch box to emphasise his attacks on Ed Miliband. Once the Labour leader had gone through all his six questions, the glasses were folded and placed on the table of the house.\nThey had been used dramatically at yet another bad-tempered session on energy prices. I would go through the arguments on either side, but it would be simpler to use tranquilliser darts to put us all to sleep.\nCameron triumphantly accused Miliband of rejecting the Tory policy \u2013 switch your supplier \u2013 and then switching his supplier at home. Duh? Of course Miliband wants to pay less for his fuel; he just doesn't think it should be so expensive in the first place.\nMiliband's line, equally naff, was that Cameron was in league with the big energy suppliers, who were now the big seven. \"The only thing people need to do is switch prime minister \u2026\"\nCameron, he said, had originally been hard on the companies and was now on their side. \"Why has he gone from Rambo to Bambi in four short years?\" Oh dear. This is lazy sloganeering. \"Why has he gone from toughie to Tufty?\" or \"from Arafat to Puddytat?\" Write your own.\nThe PM was no better. Miliband was a \"one-trick pony that has run out of road\". Eh? One-trick ponies, even 89-trick ponies, perform not on the road but in a circus ring. But we roared onwards, with the Speaker having to halt proceedings and call for silence several times.\nCameron started to call Miliband weak, which was clearly his focus group word of the moment. Indeed, in four answers he called the Labour leader weak seven times. It was a seven-weak day! Finally, he said that Miliband had created a \"pathetic spectacle\". Unlike his own pathetic spectacles. I rather hoped he'd forget them and would have to scamper back, humiliatingly, to pick them up after his usual stalking, I-have-far-better-things-to-do-than-listen-to-you-lot, exit from the chamber. But he had tucked them back in his jacket.",

        "As more and more Internet-connected devices find their way into our homes and businesses, it\u2019s important to remember that they represent a security risk. The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly, and in the rush for convenience, our privacy and safety is often an afterthought. Leaving them unsecured is the digital equivalent of leaving the back door unlocked.\nThere are 5.5 million new things getting connected every day in 2016, as we head toward more than 20 billion by 2020, according to Gartner. That\u2019s an awful lot of devices. They might bring all sorts of handy new features, but, whether it\u2019s the latest cutting-edge baby monitor or a wireless doorbell camera that links to your phone, it\u2019s also a network-connected computer and should be treated as such. Here are eight tips to help you secure those IoT devices.\nThe first step is to consider what functionality you need from the device. Just because your TV or fridge can connect to the internet, doesn\u2019t mean you definitely want to hook it up. Take a good look at the features it offers and learn exactly what internet connectivity brings before you connect.\nMany Wi-Fi routers support guest networking so that visitors can connect to your network without gaining access to shared files or networked devices. This kind of separation also works well for IoT devices that have questionable security.\nIt\u2019s very important to pick strong passwords, but you must also make sure that you pick a different password for every device. If a hacker manages to get one of your passwords, they will typically try it with other services and devices. Reusing passwords is not a good idea. Use a password manager to keep track of all your passwords.\nSadly, UPnP can make routers, printers, cameras and other devices vulnerable to attack. It\u2019s designed to make it easier to network devices without configuration by helping them automatically discover each other. The problem is that hackers can also potentially discover them from beyond your local network because of vulnerabilities in the UPnP protocol. Is best to turn UPnP off completely.\nIf you want to make sure you have the latest security patches and reduce the chances of a successful attack, then you need to keep your firmware fully updated. Vulnerabilities and exploits will be fixed as they emerge, so your IoT devices and your router need to be regularly updated. Automate this wherever possible or set a schedule to check for updates every three months or so.\nDon\u2019t take your personal IoT devices to work. There are lots of potential security concerns for wearables. Every enterprise should have a clear BYOD policy, and it\u2019s often a good idea to prohibit personal IoT devices from connecting to the network, or at least limit them to a guest network.\nBusinesses need to track everything connected to the network and monitor the flow of traffic. Devices need to be assessed to determine the level of access they should have, to keep them fully patched and up to date, and to protect data end-to-end to preserve its integrity. Unknown devices should flag an alert. Understanding which devices are connected and what they\u2019re doing is a prerequisite for proper security.",
        "Axis Bank chief Shikha Sharma has said called for creating a better credit culture for the long-term benefits and opined that one way to achieve that is to debar defaulting promoters from bidding for their assets during insolvency proceedings.\nMumbai: Axis Bank chief Shikha Sharma has said called for creating a better credit culture for the long-term benefits and opined that one way to achieve that is to debar defaulting promoters from bidding for their assets during insolvency proceedings.\nWith the Reserve Bank doing away with all the past dispensations to resolve the bad loan problem, and voting for initiation of insolvency proceedings against erring borrowers, there is a need to strengthen the National Company Law Tribunals (NCLTs), she said.\n\"Certainly a lot more cases are going to go to the NCLT; so it is important that their capacity is expanded so that they can deal with all cases,\" the managing director and chief executive of the third largest private sector lender told PTI in an interview recently.\nSharma said there is \"some conversation\" on this aspect already and added the RBI would have kept such a requirement in mind already.\nShe said the promoters of companies against whom banks have initiated insolvency proceedings should be kept out of the bidding process for the same assets for the long-term benefit of improving credit culture.\nA short-term goal for banks would be to look at maximising the value from the assets which are being put up for bidding and that can happen by allowing the promoters to bid for the assets, while from a longer-term perspective getting the right credit culture where every borrower repays is more important, she said.\n\"I believe in the long-term as opposed to the short- term. You can take some pains in the short-term as long as the right things are happening in the long-term,\" Sharma said.\nShe said the NCLT-based resolution mechanism is aimed at \"doing the right things for the medium- to long-term\".\nAxis Bank's strategy is also aligned with the same thought of ensuring gains in the long-term, she added.\nThe comments come even as reports say that in case of Essar Steel, one of the earliest and the largest accounts mandated by the RBI to be resolved through the NCLT, the promoter Ruia family has teamed up with the Russian lender VTB to wrest back the company through the bidding.\nEssar Steel has a debt of over Rs 45,000 crore and a joint venture of Arcelor Mittal and Japanese alloy major Nippon Steel is the lone competitor for the Ruias' bid being done through a firm called Neumetal in which a Ruia family member owns 25 per cent through a Mauritius-based trust.\nWhen asked if promoters are getting a backdoor entry by teaming up with other investors and where does that leave the concerns on credit culture, Sharma said, \"I think we are jumping the gun.\"\nSharma also welcomed the NCLT process as a very strong and responsive mechanism which has shown a willingness to change if there is a need.\n\"One should recognise NCLTs for the fact that it is seldom that you see that a legislation gets written and implemented as quickly as NCLT...In the next three-four months we'll have a better idea of exactly how the whole NCLT process has worked,\" she said.\nWhen asked about the loss of credit culture through farm loan waivers across various states, Sharma acknowledged about the difficulties but declined to elaborate.\n\"Every time there is a talk of farm loan waiver, there is an increase in defaults on agricultural loans because people feel they don't need to pay up. We live in a complex economy,\" she said.\n\"There is a big debate out there on growth versus inclusion. I don't know whether anybody has the right answers.\nYou have had Communism, Socialism, capitalism...I don't think if we have a clear winner yet.\"",
        "Can you use junk to keep your home decor fresh?\n(ARA) - As colder weather arrives, you are probably looking to freshen up your home decor. While it might be counterintuitive, a great way to do this is by using items you might not otherwise have a need for - or to put it bluntly, junk.\nYou may have already heard about a growing trend called \"junking,\" which involves incorporating junk in your home decor. This allows for imaginative self-expression, endless possibilities for original design, and the ability to make your interiors stylishly green. Another plus is that you'll save a little green too, since you won't be buying as many new items.\nSue Whitney knows a thing or two about breathing new life into things some would consider junk. She's been leading the trend for the last decade, founding the premiere junking website www.junkmarketstyle.com and appearing on NBC's The Today Show as the junking expert. Whitney has also written three instructional books on the topic.\n\"Integrating junk in your home decor is not confined to flea market decorating,\" says Whitney. \"I love flea market shopping, but there are countless other spots sweet on junk. Salvage yards, used restaurant supply stores and farm sales are just a few of the many alternatives.\"\nThe right products and tools are essential for crafting unique junk projects. Hammers, nails and super glue are good essentials to start with, in your junker's toolbox. Gorilla Super Glue is the perfect adhesive if you are looking to embellish your finds with other objects. For creating projects and other project fixes, the original Gorilla Glue works well.\n* A little repositioning of furniture and accessories, a change of accent color, and a few new junk acquisitions or creative projects will take you down the transition highway quickly and easily. For example, tightening up your conversation pits will make your rooms seem cozier. You can achieve this by simply moving your furniture a bit closer and adding a few extra accessory junk pieces. When it's cool outside, the closer, the better.\n* Vintage pillows and throws are staples in the junking world. Trade in your light and bright cotton throws for ones with autumnal colors and cozy wool. Accent pillows with contrasting vintage textiles on either side will take you directly from summer to fall with a single flip.\n* Thoughtfully combining colors and textures is a key element in cultivating good junk design. Trends for the season are all basic and neutrals. Galvanized metal, warm woods, whitewashed architectural salvage and weathered concrete pieces provide a stunning and timeless backdrop for your home.\nFor projects and more creative junking ideas from Sue Whitney, visit www.gorillatough.com.",
        "Soon you\u2019ll be able to personalize your order at McDonald\u2019s just like you can at Amazon.\nYou may have heard that McDonald\u2019s has acquired a machine-learning startup, Dynamic Yield.\nThe hamburger chain MCD, +1.21% plunked down $300 million in lunch money.\nLike any other machine-learning-based artificial-intelligence (AI) tool, this one will take external data into account \u2014 is it cold/hot outside? Have you purchased meals before? What\u2019s your favorite flavor, etc. \u2014 and try to suggest a product that works best. A Hot Fudge Sundae may be offered more frequently on hot days; if you like chocolate, chocolate-based desserts may be displayed first, etc. Upsale and cross-selling will most likely get an upgrade too \u2014 instead of simply offering a larger menu, a more customer-appropriate side dish may also get bundled.\nAll that will be based not only on existing database entries and criteria, but also on a \u201clearn-as-you-go\u201d method in which AI adapts and improves, making it increasingly efficient to meet customer needs in a better, faster and more profitable way for the company. Simply put, it\u2019ll get smarter as more customers interact with it.\nAI was given a test run in several restaurants last year, and it seems that the company\u2019s head honchos were happy with its performance. Daniel Henry, McDonald\u2019s chief information officer, told Wired he expects to see the technology in 1,000 locations within the next three months, eventually rolling out to the company\u2019s 14,000 U.S. restaurants and beyond.\nThe AI integration likely will expand to kitchen management, in-store kiosks, mobile ordering and payment procedures. With 68 million customers served daily and more than 35,000 restaurants worldwide, there\u2019s plenty of data for AI to store and learn from.\nThis move did not come unwarranted. McDonald\u2019s queried 30 candidate companies that offer similar personalization services, and only Digital Yield made the cut. Before getting acquired, the company already provided services to more than 300 brands worldwide, including Ikea, Sephora and Urban Outfitters.\nThe acquisition not only proves the quality of Digital Yield\u2019s work, but it also shows that a growing number of companies have recognized the main advantage of a combination of big data and AI: mass personalization. That is, the ability to customize goods and services to appeal to a large number of people, while keeping up with their quirks and personal preferences. I believe McDonald\u2019s is taking a step in the right direction, one that its competitors (and those beyond the fast-food industry) will most likely follow.\nWhat do you think?

The 75-pound structure contains approximately 15,000 inches of hosiery, mostly using the waistband due to its durability and flexibility. An armature supports the sculpture; it was made to resemble the circular knitting machines Soucie used during the creation process.

        "Ivanna Klympush-Tsynadze is Ukraine's deputy Prime Minister in charge of European affairs.\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivanna Klympush-Tsynadze, tasked with European integration, described in an interview the importance of the country\u2019s Association Agreement with the EU. EURACTIV Spain reports.\nThe Ukraine\u2013European Union Association Agreement entered into force on 1 September 1 \u2013 an important step for bilateral relations. For the past three months, Ukrainians have been able to travel to the EU without a visa.\nIvanna Klympush-Tsynadze explained what this agreement entails for her country, what her government has done until now and what Ukraine can offer to the EU.\nWhat are the primary benefits for Ukraine?\nWe see this Agreement as a reform plan to achieve the successful economic and political systems of European member states. We already started to reform before the Agreement came into force.\nThe Agreement is highly ambitious and resembles the plans that Eastern European countries adopted before entering the EU. A complex agreement such as this depends on all actors in Ukraine who initiated this momentous change, as well as civil society, to succeed.\nBut we are aware that our efforts alone are not sufficient, but we need the EU\u2019s technical and economic support to ensure that all these changes are actually implemented on schedule.\nUkraine\u2019s current government has achieved visa-free travel to the EU for your citizens. What does this mean for EU-Ukraine relations?\nI believe this was hugely important for Ukraine. We cut ties with our Soviet past, the Russian empire. The EU\u2019s acknowledgement of all our efforts was instrumental. We worked closely with the president, the parliament, civil society and our European partners.\nI am saddened by the setbacks this process is suffering from \u2013 and not due to Ukraine but to internal EU affairs. I hope these political barriers, which weighed on the decision to enlarge visa-free travel, have less importance in European member states. I see a centrist swing within many countries, which are open to engaging in cooperation with Ukraine.\nExtending the visa regime also means enhancing personal and trade relations. It entails a clearer understanding of who Ukrainians are and putting an end to the myths which the Russian Federation promotes to European countries. This direct communication between citizens will yield positive results for the process of European integration.\nUkraine\u2019s government has talked repeatedly of \u201cthe European future of the country\u201d. What does Ukraine have to offer to the EU?\nNot only can we advance these gains, but we are already doing a lot. Right now Ukraine is the frontier of the West. On the Eastern border, we are protecting against a Russian attack. This is how we are contributing to EU\u2019s security.\nUkraine is a large country, with an educated labour force. It is a safe country for investment, a market for EU products, and a quality producer in numerous sectors including food production and innovation. We are leaders in IT industry among developing countries. So we have a lot to offer in economic and security terms.\nYou said in an interview that the Association Agreement \u201cis a difficult task\u201d. What are the biggest challenges to overcome?\nThe biggest challenge is that in some sectors the result of our reforms are not immediate, and citizens will appreciate the benefits with time. We need widespread support to really bring about change.\nFor instance, implementing the EU\u2019s environment directives is a hard job. Citizens do not see its short-term importance, and the long term ecological risks lying ahead. People do not think about the long term \u2013 they want to see results in one or two years. But some results are only visible in a decade or so, and these changes are harder to achieve.\nWhat are the areas where change has been implemented?\nWe started working at 360 degrees. One of the most important reforms is in the energy sector. Ukraine is in currently changing the natural gas and electricity markets, which were priorly non-existent.\nWe decided to sell Naftogaz, a gas and oil transport monopoly. We are privatizing this sector, and becoming a more efficient state in the process. The government raised the price of gas for enterprises and individuals, and this is an important step against corruption.\nAnother key project is the change in public procurement processes. This system is more advanced that in some European countries. The \u201cProzorro\u201d e-procurement system has been compulsory since last August. This year, we saved about 20% of public spending through this system. It is also a strong tool against the plight of corruption in this field.\nWe are adopting a new system for food safety and security, which is not Soviet-derived.\nBrussels has asked Ukraine to ensure democratic processes and fight against corruption. What advances have been made in this area?\nI already mentioned the energy sector, which is one of the most corrupt. We have launched new laws against corruption. This allowed us to create new state bodies such as the national bureau for the fight against corruption, a corruption attorney, and the national agency for preventing corruption.\nWe have launched an e-system for the declaration of revenues of high profile political figures and public officials, which is accessible to the public, to journalists, and to international partners. The national agency for preventing corruption looks at these declarations, and then the national bureau for the fight against corruption investigates violations and refers them to the attorneys.\n125 people have already been sentenced and large quantities of money and revenue have been returned to public coffers.\nWe are finally working to heal the country from something which had been affecting it for too long, and we are seeing the first results of these new institutions.\nAn incredible achievement of the past three years has been to restore confidence in the banking sector. Out of 190 banks, we closed all those we deemed inefficient.\nThe challenge lying ahead is the reform of the judiciary, which is the weak spot of all efforts against corruption. I am pleased we held an open election for judges sitting on the Supreme Court. We hope that the constitutional changes we wrote in this area will give the desired results and gather momentum for a reform of the country\u2019s judiciary. It will take time. In Ukraine, we have more than 7,000 judges and it is impossible to change them all at once.\nWhat obstacles did Kiev face in the negotiation process with Brussels about reforms?\nUkrainians are the main supporters of reforms. The president, the parliament, the government and Ukrainians at large all have an interest in implementing reforms \u2013 it is not a question of \u201cwhat Brussels says\u201d. We are not reforming because of Brussels. We are doing it so that our citizens feel better protected, to allow our country to grow, to access European markets, create the conditions for international trade, and attract investors.\nIn terms of obstacles, the largest one is the reform of government in Ukraine, which we started last year and are currently working on. It is impossible to have strong institutions without paying civil servants an appropriate salary and thus disincentivise corruption. But with a larger number of professional civil servants, we will be able to do it.\nWe are also trying to eliminate superfluous functions from the ministries, such as managing public enterprises. Privatising these companies will allow for a more flexible governance, and the state will deliver more efficient services to its citizens. But we are facing a lot of opposition from the old system.\nEvery effort we do requires a strong will and more time than we would like. The system was focused on process and not results, and we are breaking this cycle. It is a collective effort for the government, the parliament, civil society and our foreign partners.\nOne of the things worrying the EU is the ongoing conflict with eastern Ukraine. What is your government doing to improve the situation?\nUkraine wants a political and diplomatic resolution to the conflict. We want to highlight that this was an act of aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine \u2013 in 21st century Europe. This is a gross violation of international obligations and international treaties: from the illegal annexation of Crimea to the intervention of Russian troops in Eastern Ukraine.\nWe are working with the Normandy format (Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine) to resolve the situation. We are coordinating our actions with the French and German delegations. Ukraine is respecting all of its commitments. But unfortunately, we regularly notice violations by Russian mercenaries on the Ukranian ground outside of Kiev\u2019s control.\nObviously, our army must respond to protect the civilian population. Violations by Russian mercenaries are a regular occurrence and they also prevent independent OECD observers from entering the area.\nRussia is directly violating the Minsk protocol. During negotiations, we see that Russia is not ready to discuss humanitarian issues, like the release of hostages illegally detained in conflict areas, and of political prisoners held in Russia.\nThe number of troops and weapons deployed by Russia in the conflict keeps rising.\nWe are working with international organizations to increase their presence and surveillance role because we want the world to have objective facts. This will allow us to restore Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.",
        "The word one must avoid is \"timeless.\" \"Timeless\" brings bad luck. Nothing tempts the gods so much as the arrogance of a timeless skyscraper.\nAnd yet, no one minds arrogance these days, and a bit of hubris never hurt anyone; even a lot of it--to quote Michael Douglas in his role as greedy arbitrageur--can be a good thing! The greed of big business and the arrogance of big builders have given us vistas and sky views that rival anything from Mount Olympus. Skyscrapers, after all, are about business the way Manhattan is about buildings.\nThe sense of danger and awe that any large structure automatically invokes to those of us who are superstitious but not afraid of heights may never have crossed the architect's mind.\nYou can criticize skyscrapers for their irreverent arrogance, but you can't accuse them of defying the odds. This, after all, is what skyscrapers are supposed to do; this is what they have in common with the man who threw a cable between both towers of the World Trade Center and then proceeded to walk on it. They defy the odds, look the odds in the face and stick their tongue out, as did another fearless soul, the New York Times photographer Ernie Sisto, when he asked two colleagues to hold him by the legs while he climbed out onto a ledge high on the Empire State Building and, aiming down, got the angle he wanted for his photograph of the huge hole left by a B-25 bomber that had crashed into the building.\nMention any book on skyscrapers and its pages will invariably round up the usual nouns: pride, power, glory, ambition, splendor, defiance. The vaulting arrogance of the Woolworth Building, the sleek opulence of the Flatiron Building, the guarded splendor of the Chrysler, the garish plenitude of the Ansonia. The adjectives trickle down with the two-bit eloquence of someone trying to avoid the obvious word: \"timeless.\"\nTimeless, however, is an irrelevant concept--and for totally modern reasons. We have grown wiser with the centuries and no longer build skyscrapers the way people used to build pyramids. We build for the long haul, but not for eternity.\nThe most cursory glance at Sarah Bradford Landau and Carl W. Condit's spectacular Rise of the New York Skyscraper, 1865-1913, tells the sad tale plainly enough: The Washington Life Building (demolished), Commercial Cable Building (demolished), Gillender Building (demolished), St. Paul Building (demolished)--and the list goes on. The long haul, it turns out, is not long enough. And here-to-stay is really here-today.\nGone-tomorrow! And this, in the end, is the untold tale that the builders of the Parthenon, of the Lighthouse, of the Circus Maximus or of Versailles would never have understood. We don't quite understand it ourselves: not that all things come down in the end, but that the end must come so soon.\nThere is after all something even more arrogant than building the Tower of Babel. It is building it and then, on second thought, tearing the whole thing down again. Our arrogance may be more circumspect that King Nimrod's, but it is also tackier. It lacks what our buildings try so hard to convey: grandeur.\nBut then, perhaps, there lies the magic of a skyscraper: that it exists, that it still holds, that its lease on land may be renewed another 10 years. When we stand aloft and see the rest of mankind turn to ants or fear that we might slip and fall, though we know we can't, it is the vulnerability of adjoining skyscrapers that mystifies us, not ours.\nIn Gordon Coster's photograph of the Chrysler Building (1929), it is its towering temerity pensively, meekly awaiting the end that sobers the viewer, just as no one can look at Karl Struss' picture of a Pennsylvania Station basking in powerful mid-afternoon light and not think that these places are, after all, quite defenseless.\nDemolition is an art form itself. We see three photos: One minute the building stands, then a cloud of smoke, and then, in the third take, nothing but rubble. There are more humorous variations on the theme: the Metropolitan Life Insurance Tower leaning at a 45-degree angle, toying with the idea of its own collapse. Man Ray's tilted model of a skyscraper.\nStrangely enough, pictures and photographs of skyscrapers are seldom austere, cold or minatory; instead they grace the stones with almost-languorous bewilderment that is almost like love.\nCity of Ambition, Artists and New York, a beautiful collage of scenes from New York that does not mean to provide a comprehensive portrait of the city, toys with the contrast between massive structures and human memory. The book itself is arranged in a way that dramatizes this contrast, for it mixes poetry, paintings and photographs, some capturing the masonries, people at work, out to lunch, in an employment agency, at a Bendel's sale, at the movies, and, of course, the unavoidable el train and occasional homicide scene.\nHere, the contrast between Hopper's tenement and the skyscraper is not intended to emphasize the fact that perfectly shaped tributes to affluence were being erected while people were starving during the Depression, but rather that these buildings, so austerely aloof, so unliving, and so visibly spared from the humdrum, day-to-day nonsense of daily jostling existed in a manner that Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" might have considered unthinkable.\nThe subway station, and the Brooklyn Bridge, and the old street vendors on Houston Street belong to the same world, the way, even today, a walk along a row of sparkling skyscrapers in Manhattan must ultimately cross the invasive earthy odor of fried bacon or shish kebab. That both can exist in so tight a strip of land is the small miracle of Manhattan. George Bellows' Pennsylvania Station Excavation and Edward Hopper Apartment Houses, Harlem River, and Alvin Langdon Coburn the Flat-Iron Building are, in this respect, part of the same city.\nIf there is anything timeless in this melange, it is not so much because these structures might endure for a very long time. Nor is it because we want them to endure, because in more ways than one our lives are so intimately braided into these buildings that if they were to go, part of us would go as well.\nBut rather if there is something timeless in this symbiosis it is because, in looking at Berenice Abbott's \"The Night View,\" a stunning aerial photograph of speckling New York skyscrapers, one must constantly remind oneself that it was taken, not last night, but 60 years ago, that New York has not really changed since, that if it hasn't we haven't, that it is still very livable, that it is not, and might ever be, the metropolis we each fear it might suddenly become one day.",

        "Richard H Kirk spent much of his career waiting for the future. He remains a resident of Sheffield, a city with a rich tradition in electronic music, once home to Warp Records, as well as the Human League, Heaven 17 and Moloko among others. However, when he, Stephen Mallinder and Christopher Watson formed Cabaret Voltaire in 1973, fired up by Eno-era Roxy Music and William Burroughs's cut-up techniques, there was no such tradition at all. \"The only musical tradition then was heavy metal, rubbish cover bands and crooners like Tony Christie.\"\nBy 1989, with Cabaret Voltaire all but petered out, a new future had arrived: rave. Warp Records would be home to a new, bespoke, Meccano-like strain of home-built techno. Early releases by LFO and Tricky Disco set the minimal tone, and then Kirk, in partnership with Richard Parrott, formed Sweet Exorcist, whose definitive CCEP/CCCD was the label's first album release in 1991. Rereleased on its 20th anniversary as RetroActivity, with additional unreleased tracks dredged up from Kirk's archive (\"I say 'archive', it's more a roomful of boxes\"), it's essentially a variation on three different tracks, with elements added and subtracted, the bare workings of breakbeats adorned by samples and loops or simply exposed. Its deconstruction/reconstruction is inspired by the ultra-minimalism of the Detroit scene of the 80s in which, as Kirk gleefully puts it, there was \"almost nothing there\".\nIronic that an experimental music veteran with 20 years behind him should be leading a fresh charge into the 90s, setting up the framework for Autechre, Aphex Twin and the whole intelligent dance music (IDM) scene, but the rise of sampling, rave and techno was the realisation of a music that codgers like Kirk had only been able to dream of decades earlier, prior to the arrival of the technology.\n\"Clubs had got quite heavy in the mid-80s,\" remembers Kirk. \"It was all designer suits and coke. That was all swept away when people started shovelling Es down their necks. I felt recharged.\"\nIt wasn't just a shift in the spirit of the times, however, from the churlish, urban aspirational 80s to the neo-hippy rural collectivism of rave. It was the availability of new technology such as the Akai S1000 sampler. \"It was one of the first you didn't need to take out a mortgage to buy. In Cabaret Voltaire we used a Fairlight in the mid-80s but it cost \u00a3100,000 so we had to rent it by the hour \u2013 and an engineer to show us how the bloody thing worked \u2026\"\nCabaret Voltaire may have taken their name from the Dada art movement, but the group weren't just cerebral tapeheads. They were also fixated on dance music \u2013 James Brown, Hamilton Bohannon \u2013 finding a logical link between the structural underpinnings of the extended 12-inch and their own experiments in drones, loops and repetitions. Punk came along but, as Cabaret Voltaire found to their cost when supporting the likes of the Buzzcocks, punk audiences were aggressively unready for them. Stephen Mallinder was hospitalised after one gig in which objects were rained on them.\nFor Kirk, the idea of not being able to play was key. \"These days, everyone samples if, say, they want a northern soul feel. In our day, we'd attempt to recreate things. And because we couldn't really replicate it, what we produced [as Cabaret Voltaire] was interesting and strange. It was the same with Warp. They received demos of what people thought was house music but it was wide of the mark \u2013 and as a result, more interesting. Sometimes music works best when you don't know what you're doing.\"\nToday, Kirk continues to record prolifically as Sandoz, Electronic Eye, and as Cabaret Voltaire, declaring himself the last founder member of the group. However, though still in touch with Mallinder and Watson, he says there is no question of their going down the Pixies/Stone Roses/My Bloody Valentine route and reuniting.\n\"It's quite clear these bands are doing it for the bloody money. I'm sure it would be lucrative but I'm not interested. I'm not 25 any more, I can't play guitar with the sort of violence I used to. It'd just be old guys trying to relive their youth.\"\nThe Irish actor makes a perfect villain for new sci-fi flick In Time, but will he make a return as Scarecrow in the next Batman film?",
        "He was born the son of a North Melbourne player and from the age of 12 he was a member of the GWS academy.\nBut now a proud Demon, first-year player Charlie Spargo is forging his own path.\nAfter arriving at the club with an injured shoulder and getting suspended in his first VFL game for the club, it\u2019s fair to say Spargo\u2019s Melbourne career didn\u2019t get off to the best start.\nBut after overcoming an extremely limited pre-season, and with some stern guidance from coach Simon Goodwin, the tenacious teenager from Albury is preparing for his second consecutive blockbuster final at the MCG.\nCharlie Spargo. tackles Sam Menegola in last week's elimination final at the MCG.\nAlthough pre-season for Melbourne players started in late November, it wasn\u2019t until late February that Spargo was able to train fully after recovering from shoulder surgery that ended his under-18 campaign.\n\u201cIt was pretty annoying. Just the competitive streak in me wanted me to be able to get out there and show what I had,\u201d Spargo told Fairfax Media.\nBut finally, after months of rehabilitation and a handful of practice matches, Spargo was handed his first competitive hit-out in the VFL in early April.\n\u201cIt was stupid, I swung my hand and got some bloke in the head. I was very remorseful,\u201d Spargo said.\nThat bloke was Coburg\u2019s Nick Mellington and Spargo was offered two matches for the strike, with the option of accepting one match with a guilty plea.\n\u201cI was pretty down in the dumps,\u201d said Spargo, who then sat down with Goodwin.\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s not what you do and not what you\u2019re about,\u201d Spargo said were Goodwin\u2019s words to him.\nIt was a tough start to his AFL career, but from that moment on, it\u2019s been smooth sailing for Spargo.\nHe came back into the VFL and knocked the door down with his form, eventually being picked for his senior debut in the round-six clash with Essendon.\nAs a 173-centimetre, 71-kilogram forward, Spargo had a combined 33 disposals and kicked three goals in his first two games.\nHe\u2019s become an important weapon in Melbourne\u2019s forward-pressure artillery and Friday night\u2019s semi -final against Hawthorn will be his 17th game of the year.\nAnd while Spargo\u2019s final for the Demons will be on Friday night, he may well have been playing alongside Toby Greene for GWS on Saturday, had the AFL not stripped the Giants of part of their academy zone.\nIn March last year, Spargo was less than a week away from playing the GWS academy team when his parents received a phone call from the AFL.\nSpargo\u2019s home town Albury was part of the area the league had decided to strip from the Giants, much to the club's anger.\nSpargo\u2019s parents, Paul \u2013 who played 90 games for North Melbourne and the Brisbane Bears \u2013 and Kate, were as shocked as Charlie.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really sure what was going to happen,'' Spargo said. ''I thought I was going to go to the Giants. I was settled with that, I\u2019d thought about it a fair bit.\nPaul and Kate will make their second 320-kilometre trip down the Hume Highway to the MCG inside two weeks, and Charlie chuckles at the fact that he\u2019s even managed to turn his Dad into a Demons\u2019 fan.\nSpargo is enjoying the simplicity of his football at the moment.\nSpargo added: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about possession numbers because if you look around at a lot of the good small forwards, they get low possessions, maybe three or four tackles, and if you get one or two goals, then you\u2019re lucky.",
        "In Lean Times, Creative Bakers Turn To Desperation Pies : The Salt Vinegar pie and green tomato pie don't usually top the list of America's favorite sweets. But in Depression-era America, these and other desperation pies that survive today showed off home cooks' ingenuity.\nSome desperation pies, like green tomato pie, still enjoy niche popularity today.\nImagine yourself as a resourceful farmer during the Great Depression. You'd like to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, like cherries or pecans, are too expensive or not available.\nDesperate times call for desperation pies (or starvation recipes, if you happen to be in Greece).\nAlso known as \"make-do\" pies, desperation pies were made with any ingredients a farm cook had on hand or could scrounge up at a moment's notice. \"[Desperation pie is] a pie that you made when you had nothing left to make it with,\" says food folklorist and author Joanne Raetz Stuttgen.\nAnd sometimes this meant pulling off feats of tastebud trickery that modern day chefs are rediscovering with great interest, Stuttgen tells The Salt.\nFor example, vinegar pie was the creative cook's fruit-free answer to lemon meringue pie. \"If you want a lemon meringue pie but you have no lemons, the vinegar gets the tartness like the lemon,\" says Stuttgen. Now vinegar pie is so hip, even Chef Emeril Lagasse has a version.\nSome desperation pies of yesteryear were even inspired by off-season cravings. If you wanted an apple pie, and you had a surplus of green tomatoes before the apples were ripe, tossing sliced green tomatoes to sugar and apple pie spices like cinnamon and nutmeg was a good substitute, Stuttgen says.\n\"Also, it could be something local,\" she says, \"Like if there was a blight, for instance, that destroyed pecans, you could put in oatmeal in place of the nuts. That can 'mock' the flavor and the appearance of the pecan pie.\"\nWar-time rationing also encouraged a great deal of culinary creativity. Recipes for meatless mincemeat pie, a pie usually made with chopped beef, fruits, and spices, began to emerge in patriotic World War II cookbooks with titles like Cooking Without Meat: A Supplementary Kitchen Guide for War-Time Cookery.\nAdditionally, desperation pie recipes have been shared in community cookbooks for over a century, and many traveled from region to region through these cookbooks, says Stuttgen. Today, thousands of home cooks still share their time-tested pie recipes in popular cookbooks compiled by organizations like the Junior League of Hampton Roads and the Junior League of Seattle.\nEven in times of plenty, some desperation pies, like sugar cream pie in Indiana and chess pie in the South, went on to become famous regional favorites that people still make today. \"They have a place,\" says Stuttgen, \"and they become traditional and symbolic of a region, or a family, where that pie has to be at Christmas every year.\"\nBut Stuttgen says that more than regional character, these pies show the ingenuity and creativity of the American spirit in times of struggle.\n\"These types of pies come from sheer practicality,\" she says, \"You probably cannot convincingly trace them to a specific region or a specific cultural group; instead you just have these women who are making do with what they have.\"",
        "NEW YORK \u2013 The cultural heritage of the entire country of Syria and the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, are among the diverse cultural heritage sites threatened by neglect, overdevelopment or social, political and economic change, a preservation group announced Tuesday.\nThe World Monuments Fund&apos;s watch list for 2014 includes 67 sites in 41 countries and territories, from Japan to the United States.\nThe New York-based group \u2014 dedicated to saving important landmarks from around the world \u2014 has issued its watch list every two years since the mid-1990s to call attention to sites that are threatened by neglect, vandalism, conflict or disaster.

The modern heritage sites were included because they all require creative approaches to their conservation, the fund said.\nAlso on the watch list are places threatened by what the fund called \"large-scale cruise-ship tourism.\" It said Venice, Italy, was a dramatic example of that, and said it hoped that placing the ancient city on the list would lead to an analysis of the adverse impact large vessels were having on the environment.",

(AP) \u2014 Money and memorabilia from Johnny Cash's family and friends have helped historians restore a significant part of the Historic Dyess Colony, a government collective built to pull Depression-era families out of poverty.\nThe country music icon's boyhood home, along with the colony's former headquarters, will open Saturday to reflect everyday life in a northeast Arkansas community built on once-sunken land.\n\"Restoring the Dyess Colony Administration Building, and even saving at least one of the typical colony houses, would have been a worthwhile project, even without the Johnny Cash connection,\" said Ruth Hawkins , the executive director of the Heritage Sites program at Arkansas State University.\nBefore he was the Man in Black, he was J.R. Cash , a son of Kingsland, Arkansas, farmers who successfully applied to take part in a 1930s Works Progress Administration experiment. The federal government brought in 487 families and gave them land and a mule.\n\"This was a practice in socialism,\" said Roscoe Phillips , who was born at Dyess 77 years ago. \"They took people who had nothing and gave us something. It wouldn't happen today.\"\nA restored five-room house northwest of town holds items that belonged to the singer's parents \u2014 a shaving mug in the bathroom and an upright piano atop red linoleum in the living room. J.R. shared a bedroom at the front of the house with three siblings. Although there was a toilet and bathtub, the home never had running water. Electrical service arrived in 1945.\nAt the museum back in town, Cash's 1950 Dyess High School yearbook, given to his daughter Rosanne in 2000, rests in a special wing dedicated to the singer and his family.\n\"It's been one of my most prized possessions. It's yours. Merry Christmas,\" Cash wrote to Rosanne on personal stationery with \"Johnny Cash\" scratched out and \"Dad\" written in.\nWithout Cash's fame, it'd be a lot tougher to save places like the Dyess Colony, one of nearly 100 proposed resettlement sites nationwide. Arkansas State used the same principle in 1999 when it restored Ernest Hemingway's writing studio in Piggott, 50 miles north. He worked there while married to Pauline Pfeiffer , the daughter of a prominent family.\nThe government cleared 2 acres to put up a house, a barn, a chicken coop and outhouse, then it was up to residents to clear the rest of the land, grow a crop and begin paying on a mortgage. Cash's father Ray signed his contract in February 1938 \u2014 for $2,183.60.\nStories about hard times here landed in some of Cash's songs and also Rosanne Cash's \"The Sunken Lands.\"\n\"I particularly had my grandmother Carrie Cash in mind all through the restoration process, and while writing 'The Sunken Lands,' about her and this very area,\" Rosanne Cash wrote. \"I wanted my children to know their lineage and that their great-grandparents worked harder to make a good life for their children and all their descendants than anyone could possibly imagine.\"\nAt its peak, the town had more than 2,500 residents. Now, its population is less than 500, said Larry Sims , the town's mayor. \"There was no reason to come back when you could go to Jonesboro and have all the convenience you needed,\" he said.\n\"My dad's mother saved everything. I had the original paperwork from when they were accepted to come to Dyess,\" said Russell Clifton , who now lives north of Detroit.",
        "In a democracy, it is said, we get the government we deserve. The same can be said of bestselling guru prescriptives.\nMalcolm Gladwell's new book What the Dog Saw, a compilation of some of his favorite New Yorker pieces, has drawn both praise and criticism. Personally, I'm not a big Gladwell fan. Shoot me. I'm told he's an interesting person. And he knows how to tell a good anecdote. But, at the risk of oversimplifying my critique of his work ... he oversimplifies.\nThe general thesis of Blink, for example, was \"trust your gut ... except when you shouldn't.\" Okay ... but why can you trust your gut sometimes, but not others? What does that tell us about what \"gut\" instinct really is? And what does that mean in terms of how we process information in the world? And what do we do with that knowledge? The really interesting points are left dangling. Why? I don't know, but I suspect it's because they're complex and not easily summarized ... and might muddy the simple and easily-grasped ideas or conclusions that are a trademark of Gladwell's work.\nIf I'm not a fan of Gladwell, it's because I want to see robust logic behind an argument, depth to its exploration, and acknowledgment of the complexities and contradictions it may entail. Simple, neat answers don't appeal to me, because they don't resonate with what I've experienced in the world. But clearly, I'm an outlier in that regard.\nJudging from the sales of not only Gladwell's books, but the plethora of \"3 step,\" \"7 habits,\" \"9 insights\" and other success-formula books on personal and business improvement, there's an almost ravenous hunger in the world for simple answers on how things work and how to get the game right. And that hunger has only gotten more intense as the world has gotten more complex.\nIt's an interesting phenomenon. Surely one part of our brain knows that the world, or even the world of business, is more complex than the raft of simple, success-formula books promises. And yet, like a woman who, despite multiple failed affairs, convinces herself that this married man will surely leave his wife, we ... or at least a good number of us ... keep buying the fantasy. We keep being drawn to simple-sounding answers and solutions--to the tune of almost $13 billion a year. Even when, or perhaps because, they don't pan out to be true, as a writer for The Economist pointed out in a recent column.\n\"The Three Habits ... of Highly Irritating Management Gurus\" takes the writers of those \"3-step\" and \"7-habits\" books to task on several fronts. First, for repackaging stale ideas as breakthrough insights. Second, for using seemingly \"model firm\" anecdotes to prove their points without a lot of rigorous research--anecdotes that often prove embarrassingly untrue several years down the road. And third, for ... well, peddling those \"three habit\" success-formula lists and prescriptives.\nBut \"the most irritating thing of all about management gurus,\" the author writes, is that \"their failures only serve to stoke demand for their services. If management could indeed be reduced to a few simple principles, then we would have no need for management thinkers. But the very fact that it defies easy solutions, leaving managers in a perpetual state of angst, means that there will always be demand for books like Mr. [Stephen] Covey's.\"\nIronic, but true. If writers come up with list-based solutions, and oversimplified trends or observations, it's because there's a far larger audience for that kind of book than one titled, \"Some interesting ideas that might prove useful to think about as you make your way through a very complex world.\"\nBut why is that? One would think that we'd rather have a book that offers realistic assessments and thoughts on the tough choices and complexities we face than simple panaceas that sound terrific or comforting but describe a world that bears little resemblance to the mess we generally find ourselves navigating.\nIf we don't, it's at least in part because humans are just so uncomfortable with ambiguity. There are all kinds of psychological studies on that point. We desperately want there to be a pattern, an orthodoxy, a model, or a formula we can simply implement or follow to find our way back to safe, clear, and happy endings. Even if we're told that real wisdom, strength and growth come from figuring it all out for ourselves, as we go.\nWhat's more, this tendency may be getting stronger in the next generation. I interviewed a business school professor yesterday who told me that she thinks MBA students today have a far lower tolerance for ambiguity than students she taught 20 years ago. She attributed the shift to the fact that many of today's students grew up with tightly scheduled lives and activities, leaving them little experience in exploring the world without structure, expectations, or guidelines. I think another factor may be the pressure they feel to achieve and get the \"right\" answer.\nBut whatever the reasons are, if her observation is true, then it's cause for concern. Because there are dangers to oversimplification, as recent events in both our economy and Iraq have painfully reminded us. No matter what we might like to be true, successful leadership in an increasingly complex world is going to depend not on condensing it to simple terms, or finding the right prescriptive formula, but on getting comfortable enough with ambiguity and complexity to see a way through it. One thoughtful, creative and unique step at a time.",
        "Sports|FIFA\u2019s Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It.\nFIFA\u2019s Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It.\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino\u2019s plans to reorder world soccer are being stymied by a familiar foe: Europe.\nSince proposing several major changes to the sport\u2019s calendar last spring, Infantino has spent months traveling the world hosting minisummits with the leaders of FIFA\u2019s 211 member federations. His goal is to win support for a proposal to introduce two new tournaments \u2014 an expanded World Cup for clubs and a new league for national teams \u2014 that would be underwritten by a $25 billion offer from a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.\nThe listening exercise follows repeated failures by Infantino to force the proposals through FIFA\u2019s governing council, but if they are approved they would represent the biggest changes to soccer in a generation, and their adoption \u2014 and the multibillion-dollar cash infusion to FIFA \u2014 would provide Infantino with a signature success ahead of his bid to secure a second term as FIFA president later this year.\nEach of the meetings on Infantino\u2019s tour, including the most recent one held in Marrakesh, Morocco, has included about 50 federation leaders from across soccer\u2019s six regional confederations. At the end of each session, the federation representatives are handed electronic tablets and asked to select their preferred options for the new tournaments.\nInfantino\u2019s problem is that European officials attending the meetings have stubbornly refused to offer any opinions. Instead, they have told Infantino and his team that the feelings of Aleksander Ceferin, the president of the European governing body, UEFA, and his governing council represent their views.\nSome of the Europeans balked because the list of options for the Club World Cup did not include the option of not holding the tournament, which is often an annoyance for the European champion who attends, at all. On FIFA\u2019s tablets, voters are asked to pick from only three choices: a tournament with 16, 24 or 32 teams.\nCeferin, under pressure from clubs and federations in Europe, has clashed repeatedly with Infantino over the proposed changes both to the Club World Cup and to the broader global soccer calendar, with Ceferin most frustrated by new initiatives that could challenge the hegemony of existing club tournaments like UEFA\u2019s Champions League and add to the workload of players.\nInfantino first presented details of a plan for an expanded Club World Cup at a FIFA Council meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, last March. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he refused to identify the financial backers of the proposal, which are believed to include not only SoftBank but also financing from the Middle East, which Infantino eventually denied were directly linked to sovereign wealth funds. (Saudi Arabia remains the biggest individual backer over Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund, the biggest private-equity fund ever raised.) Instead, Infantino pressed the council to let him close the deal on his own.\nEuropean leaders at the meeting balked, and Ceferin and Infantino have not held a meeting since the Colombia summit. In October, European officials threatened to walk out of the last meeting when Infantino suggested he planned to call another vote.\nThe vote did not take place; instead, FIFA set up a task force involving representatives from the six confederations and asked it to produce an acceptable plan before a scheduled FIFA Council meeting in March in Miami.\nAt the last summit, in Morocco, Infantino expressed frustration to the officials who declined to take part in the vote for his plans, according to multiple people present at the meeting.\nFIFA\u2019s task force for the two tournaments will hold its next meeting on Feb. 21 in Rio de Janeiro. As tensions grow, however, there is a chance that European executives will not attend, according to a person familiar with the continental leaders\u2019 plans.\nUEFA declined to comment. The organization has been seeking the support of European clubs and leagues to oppose Infantino\u2019s proposals. At the last two meetings, Ceferin has arrived armed with signed letters of opposition from The European Club Association, a union of the continent\u2019s top clubs, and a separate group representing the continent\u2019s domestic leagues.\nThe proposals to expand the Club World Cup and to create a new global Nations League similar to the recently created UEFA version largely have the backing of officials from South America, Africa and Asia \u2014 likely enough to win a vote should Infantino choose to take one at the Miami meeting. Any such move would exacerbate the growing rift with Europe, however, and potentially lead to a larger crisis if top clubs and leading nations from UEFA refuse to participate in the new FIFA-controlled tournaments.",
        "Australia's top order have crumbled with the bat yet again, relinquishing the ascendancy at Adelaide Oval with the hosts scrapping to 4-117 at tea on day two of the first Test against India. The opener tried to hit the big drive but got the inside edge back onto the stumps. Marcus Harris nearly caught it, with the ball barely crossing over the ropes and the umpire took some time to call it a six. Australia run-rate has been on slower side as they trail by 100 runs now. India bowled exceptionally well.\nThe decision to drop Marsh leaves Australia without a fifth bowling option and gives Indian coach Ravi Shastri an obvious first line in his final team address. The hosts will be looking to get close to India's total.\nRun-scoring hasn't been easy but Australia have played in a circumspect manner as well.\nIndia will be hoping that Shami and Bumrah score some 20 more runs. At stumps, Mohammed Shami was on six. However, he pushed one forward against Ashwin and gloved it to keeper Rishabh Pant. Harris, Marsh and Khawaja were all deceived for length by Ashwin's flight and drift, getting trapped into a guessing game as to how much the ball would spin and bounce. Post tea, Pujara added 62 runs with R Ashwin (25) for the seventh wicket. Whereas in the UAE against Pakistan, he was able to find the boundary with enough regularity to ease close-in fielders away from him and rotate the strike often enough to escape the clutches of Yasir Shah in particular, here he was gradually worn down, eventually pushing his hands into the general vicinity of Ashwin;s offbreak and being caught behind.\nKhawaja was forced to play at it and seemed to glove it to the keeper.\n\"I just had an interview with Ricky Ponting and we went through the names of Australian Test captains over the years so it is a little bit daunting to be in a bracket with some of those guys\".\nHead was batting well but it looked like the hosts were in a tough spot on a hard track. Two came off Cummins; the first a pull shot that sailed for six and the other a proper cover drive that cleared the ropes as well. Together they faced 59 balls and put on 22 runs in a bid to keep the scoreboard ticking. \"I just ask you to please respect my privacy and my family's privacy during this time\".\n\"And, hopefully, this time around, a full series\", said Kohli, who recently became the fastest to reach 10,000 runs in ODIs, surpassing India legend and former captain Sachin Tendulkar.",
        "Aaron Sorkin's newsroom drama More As This Story Develops is closing in on its female cast - as Marisa Tomei has been pegged for the female lead and Olivia Munn as well as Alison Pill are negotiating for supporting roles.\nMore As This Story Develops is the working title for Sorkin's latest project, now in the pilot stage at HBO. It follows cable news anchor Will McCallister (Jeff Daniels, State of Play) and his production team as they report and interpret the news on his show.\nMarisa Tomei is being pursued for the female lead, in the role of the news show's executive producer Mackenzie. While Tomei isn't in active negotiations like the other two women mentioned, she's considered the front-runner for the part. Oscar-winner Tomei's recent projects include Darren Aronofsky drama The Wrestler in 2008 and The Lincoln Lawyer.\nOlivia Munn is slated to play a young financial analyst with her own show on the same fictional cable network. She's currently in negotiations to take the part - after turning down numerous other pilots this season. Munn gained notoriety as a talk show hostess on cable gaming channel G4, before scoring a recurring \"correspondent\" role on The Daily Show - and later a lead in NBC's short-lived comedy Perfect Couples.\nAlison Pill's role is Maggie, a young associate producer on the news show. While only 25, Pill has shown a surprising range, playing in everything from Milk to Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. More As This Story Develops would be Pill's second HBO project - after an arc on In Treatment.\nSorkin has made a name for himself by staying on the bleeding edge of events and culture. The West Wing quickly became a running commentary on the Bush administration, and The Social Network tackled the country's obsession with digital communication and the pitfalls therein. The often blurry line between news and entertainment, especially on cable, seems like a winning choice for the writer-producer.\nIt would be hard to go wrong with Marisa Tomei, especially considering Sorkin's history with strong female characters. Mackenzie sounds a lot like a remixed version of CJ, Allison Janney's tough-as-nails Press Secretary character on The West Wing. Pill has proven herself a capable actress, and should find it easy enough to adapt to Sorkin's lightning pace and witty style.\nMunn, I'm not so sure of. While she has recognition in the geek community for her positions on G4 and Comedy Central, Perfect Couples left something to be desired. But the blame for the lackluster comedy can't be placed entirely on Munn's shoulders, and her roles in Iron Man 2 and Date Night were too fleeting to form a critical opinion.\nMore As This Story Develops is in the pilot stage, and should begin shooting in the next few months.",
        "In 1996, McCall magazine published a \u201cHow do you relieve stress?\u201d column highlighting how different people relaxed. As one of those interviewed, I described how watching my three dogs interact was soothing to me.\nNot only did my dogs help me relax, but also their unique way of interacting, sharing the spotlight and taking or following the lead, taught me much about how to successfully interact with people in my own life. At the time, I was running special programs for Montefiore Medical Center and private practices in Irvington and Chappaqua, New York. I instinctively knew the dogs\u2019 teachings were of significant help to me even though the health benefits of having pets were not common knowledge or fodder for research back then.\nFifteen years later, science has caught up with what so many of us instinctively knew: Pets help improve our health.\nToday, as I get ready to write my fifth book, still see patients in two offices four days a week, write articles, participate in media events, and even train physicians, the one thing that has kept me grounded and given me the proper perspective on my hectic life is always my dogs.\nWhile the wonderful dogs I had in 1996 are no longer here, a new generation of brilliant, loyal, loving, and funny dachshunds keeps me in line and teaches me how to be a better person. My health, which thankfully, is great because I follow my own advice and take supplements and bioidentical hormones, eat a balanced diet, exercise, and get eight hours of sleep, is even better due to the never-ending kisses and wonderful greetings I get at the end of every day from my dog family.\nNow research shows that unless you\u2019re someone who really dislikes animals or is too busy to care for pets, you will relieve stress and enjoy numerous other health benefits by having a furry friend.\nImprove mood. It\u2019s virtually impossible to stay in a bad mood when a pair of loving puppy eyes meets yours, or when a super-soft cat rubs up against your hand. A recent study found that men with AIDS were less likely to suffer from depression if they owned a pet.\nLower blood pressure. The most commonly used drugs to treat hypertension aren\u2019t as effective at reducing blood pressure as having pets around is. A fun study looked at groups of hypertensive New York stockbrokers given dogs or cats and found those with the pets had lower blood pressure and heart rates than those who didn\u2019t get pets. I bet many of those who didn\u2019t have a pet ran out and got one after learning the results of the study. They certainly would have been well-advised to.\nGet more exercise. Dog owners spend more time walking than non-pet owners, especially in urban settings. Owning a dog can be credited with increasing all the health benefits associated with increased physical activity. People who own pets know you cannot be too sedentary with them around.\nConnect socially. When we\u2019re out walking, having a dog (or a cat) with us makes us more approachable and provides a reason to stop and talk to other people. This increases the opportunity to stave off social isolation, which is a big stressor for many.\nHaving a pet isn\u2019t for everyone. For some, a pet can cause stress. However, for most of us, the benefits of having a pet outweigh any drawbacks. Having a furry best friend can reduce stress in your life and bring you support when times get tough. So, don\u2019t wait for a nursing home visit by a furry friend; get one today!\nAnd if you want my opinion, long-haired dachshunds make the best pets. But don\u2019t take my word for it; ask Jasper, Henry, or Teddy.\nFor more information, please email me at: Erika@drerika.com.\nPets improve human health and happiness by helping relieve stress, showing unconditional love, and connecting people.",
        "How did Quark manage to get the massive market share that it has of the publishing world? Was it the typographical precision?\nBecause we have the best product. Quark has 90 per cent of the share in publishing and that\u2019s reasonable (laugh). Reliability, ease of use and a very strong architecture so that it is flexible and can be changed, and the extensions. I have people coming to me and saying that when they use the competitor\u2019s products, they spend double the time. And time is quite valuable.\nI think that it is because we have spent tremendous amount of time and energy trying to understand what makes a customer happy when he uses it. You are correct also that we have tremendous precision. We supported very strong typographical features way earlier than anybody else. It is not just the features, it feels better.\nHow did you all come up with the idea of having something like Quark?\nThe company was started by a partner of mine (Tim Gill, see box), who is no longer a shareholder He came from the computer side and I came from the computer and publishing background. When we got involved, both of us wanted to democratise publishing. In those days, because of the expensive cost of pre-press processes, very few people could publish. It took millions of dollars to start a publication.\nWe thought that it would be a good contribution to the world if we provided tools so that people with modest means could publish. So we used our skills as engineers and when we shipped QuarkXPress 1.0 there were only eight of us. Five were engineers and the rest administrative, accounting staff, etc. It took us nine months to ship QuarkXPress 1.0. It was a labour of love.\nSoftware engineer Tim Gill founded Quark in 1981, producing the first word processor for the Apple II computer. Gill named the company Quark after the subatomic particle proposed as a building block for all matter.\nFred Ebrahimi, Quark\u2019s president and CEO, came on board in 1986. A year later the company released QuarkXPress 1.0, sparking a publishing revolution. During the next few years, Quark focused on perfecting the features, such as typography, hyphenation, multilanguage capabilities, and professional output features that have made QuarkXPress the most popular publishing software among designers, publishers and printers around the world. By the early 1990s, QuarkXPress had solidified its position as the industry leader in the electronic publishing market.\nWe started in June,1986 and we shipped in March, 1987.\nBy that time you had other products for desktop publishing?\nNot desktop publishing, but word processing. We had a product called Word Juggler for Apple II.\nPage Maker was, however, there.\nYes. Page Maker had an extensive market share. There were 50 other products, including Ready Set Go. It\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t have any competition.\nYou did well till QuarkXPress 4, which did not quite turn out to be as it was expected.\nWe made a mistake with Quark 4.0. I have apologised publicly. We didn\u2019t test it enough. We had great new features. What we didn\u2019t do is test it as strongly as we should have and Quark 4.1, subsequently, solved those problems and we have made a commitment that Quark 5.0 will not ship till our customers say \"ship.\"\nWhat is the direction that 5.0 will be going in?\nWell, the most significant issue of 5.0 is we are producing a tool that would enable you to go to print and, with the same person and same recourses, be able to create a Web page with it conveniently.\nThe HTML output from 5.0 is very powerful, from which you could produce, for example, e-books (in Microsoft Reader), Flash or SVG. There is one thing that is very important to understand about this strategy\u2014we all know that publishers are losing money on the Web. There is no substantial revenue there, but they have to do it anyway. They have to have a Web site, they can\u2019t say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Web site.\u2019 And right now they have all the additional cost without the revenue to compensate. So it is a losing proposition. We think that we are making a major contribution there. You could do what you make money at \u2013 namely, print publications, and at the same time put things on the Web without an additional cost. That\u2019s the strategy. Obviously we have added many features, like tables, layers, but those are not as important as this fundamental issue.\nSo, in effect, Quark is moving from print publishing to conversion.\nAnd in this you are supporting the industry standard in HTML, compatible with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3)?\nAbsolutely. Actually the vehicle we use is XML. Quark is a senior member of W3 and we use very clean, standard HTML output. None of the crazy derivatives that you have problems with later on. In fact, you could take the HTML that we produce and take it to a product like Dreamweaver and additionally modify it if you wish.\nOur commitment first is to our installed base. They are the ones who have stuck with us, good or bad; they have paid us, they have given us great ideas, and criticised us. We love publishing and we are not going to abandon it, as other companies are doing. We are committed to publishing. I have it in my blood. I love publishing and a lot of our staff is from publishing background and we are doing everything we can to help publishing.\nWhat are the other Quark products?\nA very good example is Quark Digital Media System, or DMS, and quite a bit of work on it is being done in this very building (Chandigarh). The same is the case with QuarkXPress 5.0.\nThe whole thing about DMS is the ability to store the content and deploy it, whether for print or Internet or whatever you want it for. It seamlessly integrates with QuarkXPress to allow you to easily reuse individual elements from QuarkXPress pages in a variety of publications.\nWe have to admit that we are pleasantly surprised that not only the publishing industry likes it, like the Independent newspaper in South Africa, but we also have customers like mail order catalogue firms, banks, and financial institutions like Barclay using it. It is a very powerful product for us and it is generating very good revenue.\nIt has a very tight integration with QuarkXpress, though we also support other programs like PhotoShop and Microsoft Word.\nQuark Wrapture is for very sophisticated packaging design; you can look at it three dimensionally and so on\u2026. We have not tried to market it in India, but basically in the USA and Japan.\nMost of the work on Mirim (data analysis and decision support tools for examining historical and real-time sales data from the Internet and print promotions) is being done here (in Chandigarh). It is about seeing how effective a marketing campaign is, because a lot of times people spend tremendous amount of money in marketing and retail campaigns for certain merchandise but don\u2019t know how effective it is, who buys it, why he buys it and so on. Mirim combines date from existing order management systems, digital images from catalogues and web pages and data from e-commerce systems, resulting in a single solution for direct marketing professionals.\nWhy did you come to India in the first place? What has your Indian experience been like?\nI am an explorer. Being an Iranian, this is like a second home to me. I feel comfortable. My wife loved it, my children love it. There is an affinity.\nI have to admit that from a business point of view, it wasn\u2019t a number one priority at first. It was a personal issue and we have enjoyed it here. There are difficulties, I don\u2019t want to in any form or shape disregard those, but it is worth it.\nWhat is it that makes it worth it?\nIn a very modest way, we feel that we have made a difference here. That means a lot to me.\nWhat exactly is the kind of work that you are doing here?\nThis is what makes us significantly different from other companies. We do truly original work We treat our engineers exactly the same way as we do in the USA and they are treated exactly the same way as they would be in the USA or Germany, and get the same respect as they would in the USA. We have people here who are working on QuarkXPress 5.0, which is obviously very important to us, it is a $100 million-a-year revenue product, they are working on DMS, on Mirim.\nWe are doing something that not too many companies are trying to do. Most other IT activities are contract work here, year Y2K and so on, and that\u2019s not the most interesting work. It\u2019s one time. You do the work and it\u2019s for a third party, which you don\u2019t even know. What we are developing is a product that many companies use so you get a different kind of satisfaction out of that.\nHas the economic slowdown in the USA affected Quark?\nYes. If any company says that the economic slowdown hasn\u2019t affected it, it\u2019s lying.\nHave you laid off anybody?\nNo. No way. We are, actually, in a hiring mode. First of all we predicted this slowdown. When everyone else was hiring, we cancelled projects in some cases. We ended up with a lower level of staff in the USA, which was a part of our strategy. We were very well prepared. We are also very liquid. We have zero debt. We are lenders to banks, not borrowers from banks. We have a very strong economic situation, so we can take advantage of this slowdown and expand.\nWe are in the expansion mode all over the world, especially in India. However, let me be very honest with you. What we are doing is that we are raising the bar of expectation. Don\u2019t be surprised if you hear that I have let someone go. Non-productive engineers are everywhere, even in this building. We weren\u2019t right with every engineer that we hired. But please don\u2019t misunderstand and think that we are lowering the staff. We are going to hire over 500 engineers in Chandigarh, as soon as we find ones who are good. Whether it takes two months, or two years.\nWhat we are not going to do is just fill the position regardless of the qualifications. We are going to be much more demanding. So Quark will be a hard place to get in.\nDuring the bubble time, a lot of expectation was built, a lot of people were given positions that they should not have been given in every company, including Quark, and corrections are needed. We are lucky in that we are prepared for this and we can go up, but a lot of companies have to cut. We are not cutting a single position because of lack of money. If we do any cutting; it is because the person is not qualified.\nWhat kind of skills is Quark looking for?\nThere is something more important than skill. You are talking to me at a very special moment. I think that before skill, we have come to the conclusion we want to look for a certain character. A lot of people were inducted in the IT business worldwide, including India, but they don\u2019t have the intellectual capacity and emotional commitment to be in the software business. People shouldn\u2019t become software developers unless they really love this and they have a tremendous caring. Frankly, I compare it to good journalism. A great journalist loves what he does. He doesn\u2019t do it for the money or for any other reason than searching for the truth.\nIn software you want to please the customer. What you should be doing is developing absolutely the best you can for the customer. That orientation is not strong outside the USA. Even in the USA, it\u2019s not all that common, though there is a little better understanding of how to find out what the customer wants. In India or Germany, they are accustomed to somebody giving the specifications, because they have done contract work, and then preparing the coding according to the specifications. They have a rigid process. It is not interactive, it is not creative. So a lot of people in India are not trying to work in such an interactive, flexible way. In fact they have been trying to be rigid. So we want a person who is creative, is open to new ideas, and is also a good engineer. But believe me, being a good engineer is secondary.\nSomebody who pushes the bubble just that little bit extra when needed?\nAnd cares. In fact, I am very seriously considering hiring non-engineers to do IT work because they bring a human side. Look, I am an engineer and I feel comfortable criticising my own kind. We are not trained to have a sense of history, of art, of humanity and so on. Very few of us read poetry.\nWe deal with formulas and questions. We see the world differently. We need those skills, but they are not hard to come by. We need to be human first.\nYou are well known for your attempts to help disadvantaged children.\nI think that it\u2019s important to have education available to disadvantaged children. I don\u2019t want them to learn about technology alone, because I think that it\u2019s even more important that they learn about humanity. So a blend of technological education and humanities is needed. So I am more than happy to do what I can reasonably do to help.\nWhat are the projects that you are working on in Chandigarh?\nWe have started with a programme for scholarships as an experiment. Forty scholarships, I believe, and they have chosen the candidates. We want to run it as an experiment and, if it is successful, I want to expand it.\nA large number of children are doing IT courses in India. What kinds of skill sets have a future? What languages have a future?\nThis is another problem in India, not just in this country, but more severely here. I think that the language, etc, are not important. But the image here is that someone heard that his or her friend is a Java programmer and is earning double the salary. Therefore, they study Java. They have no understanding of Java; they have no love of that. The language used to develop the software is number five in our list of priorities. Engineers again think that\u2019s that most important issue. That\u2019s not true.\nActually we have some serious questions about Java. Java applications have not been as efficient. The fact of the matter is that I don\u2019t know of a single, real successful Java application that has sold a lot. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with Java, we are using Java, as are millions of companies, but in some areas it is very appropriate to use C because it is much more efficient.\nTo some young kids and pundits, it becomes a religion and it\u2019s \"my religion is better than your religion,\" which is nonsense, which is garbage. You should use the right tool for doing the work and sometimes it is Java, or C++ or, at times, C. One thing is emerging as very important, that we fully support in QuarkXpress 5.0, is XML. You have got to have a way in which you can communicate all the work that you have done with something else, a way that\u2019s language independent.\nWe will have all kinds of languages. In my lifetime in computer sciences I have seen over 700 languages. I used to code myself in PL1 (Programming Language 1, used by IBM on mainframes). It\u2019s like saying that a pen is more important than the poem.",
        "Analysts predict that Apple alone could sell 28 million iPad tablets in 2011. That doesn't even take the Samsung Galaxy Tab, or the rest of the upcoming tablets expected in the next few months into consideration, and doesn't bode well for other mobile computing platforms. The netbook in particular will be the primary victim of the rise of the tablet, and will quickly be rendered obsolete.\nThe primary advantages of a netbook--when compared with larger notebook computers--are size, weight, and battery life. Netbooks are more diminutive and manage to squeeze the guts of the computer into a case generally smaller than a sheet of paper and not much thicker than a standard paperback novel when closed.\nWith the smaller physical dimensions comes a significantly lower weight as well. The average weight of netbooks ranges from two to four pounds, or about half the weight of many notebook computers. A handicap of the netbook is that it lacks an internal DVD drive in order to make the smaller case and lighter weight possible.\nOne of the biggest advantages of a netbook, though, is the extended battery life. While notebooks may last only a couple hours on a fully-charged battery, a netbook can typically make it through a full business day on a single charge.\nHowever, the biggest draw of netbooks is arguably price. With prices starting in the $200 range, and netbooks available from wireless carriers with subsidized pricing as low as $50 in exchange for a commitment to a data plan, netbooks provide a much cheaper point of entry than the traditional notebook or desktop PCs.\nThat explains the lure or a netbook when compared to a notebook, but how does the netbook stack up against the tablet? Well, the answer to that question is largely subjective and introduces a new question: what are you looking for in a mobile computing platform?\nSome will argue that the netbook still holds an advantage in that it has USB ports, larger hard drive storage capacity, and a full operating system. All of those are advantages, or possibly even deal-breakers depending on what your mobile computing needs are. The ability to simply install and run the various software applications used on a standard Windows PC rather than having to adapt to a mobile OS app culture has its benefits.\nThe Apple iPad has a larger footprint than many netbooks, but because it is a flat-panel form factor the thickness is less. At only half an inch thick, and weighing it at a pound and a half, the iPad bests netbooks in the size and weight categories.\nThe iPad boasts up to 10 hours of battery life--superior to all but the most elite netbooks. The flat touchscreen interface is much more suited for computing on the go than the netbook form factor that requires folding the computer open and involves two hands for most tasks.\nWith prices that start at $499 for the base model, though, the iPad is significantly more expensive than most netbooks. However, an armada of tablets is on the horizon built on Android, WebOS, and even Windows 7--and those may have lower prices, or use the carrier-subsidy model familiar to smartphones and netbooks now.\nSome aspects of the tablet require users to adapt to new ways of embracing mobile computing, and a culture shift from looking at it as just another portable computer form factor. That said, tablets offer most, if not all, of the advantages of netbooks, and add in some new benefits as well, making it a more compelling mobile computing platform than netbooks in many cases, and making the concept of the netbook somewhat obsolete.",

        "Baby names can't be stolen, but it's not surprising that some parents think they can.\nHaving the same name will not scar these children for life.\nMy daughter\u2019s name was very special to me. I had chosen the name for my daughter a long time before I had even conceived her because I had seen it in a special book, and I loved it instantly. I chose this name because it was a very unusual Jewish name (at the time), and I knew no one else would have it (later it became very popular).\nMy heart sank. Why would she do this? There are so many names to choose from, so why would she choose my special name? And if she wanted my name, why wouldn\u2019t she at least ask me if it was OK\u2014out of respect?\nWoolsey waited a month and then wrote an email to Jessica in which she explained her feelings of disappointment. Jessica responded \u201chatefully.\u201d It\u2019s been three years, and they haven\u2019t spoken since.\nThis belief is ridiculous\u2014after all, liking a name doesn\u2019t give you ownership over it, and sharing a name with a friend or relative is, at worst, a mild nuisance. But the idea that names shouldn\u2019t be stolen is not surprising. Over the past hundred years, naming has increasingly become an act of self-expression for parents, a way to assert their individuality rather than a sense of belonging in their community. With our names and selves so thoroughly intertwined, it stands to reason that parents would become increasingly protective of their children\u2019s names.\nBut the desire for a unique baby name might not just be about finding a way to stand out, now that standing out is the thing to do. Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, the Freakonomics team, say that baby-naming is an aspirational process motivated by financial and professional hopes for one\u2019s child. Data shows that high-income, highly educated families are the name trend setters, and they seek out names that distinguish their children from the hoi polloi. Then the name \u201cstarts working its way down the socioeconomic ladder,\u201d until, eventually, it goes out of fashion. With this in mind, parents may, consciously or not, feel that when other people use their child\u2019s name, they are also in some way compromising the likelihood of that child\u2019s future success. Nevertheless, nobody\u2019s yet provided evidence that having a popular name might actually compromise a child\u2019s future.\nAs with so much of contemporary parenting, the drama surrounding name-stealing is ultimately more about the threat it poses to parent\u2019s identities than their children\u2019s. In practical terms, no child will be harmed by having the same name as a classmate or cousin. I grew up in classrooms filled with Jennifers and Jessicas and, I promise, they all managed the name-sharing just fine. Far more punishing than having the same name as another child is growing up in an environment where names are considered personal property and friendships end when someone \u201csteals\u201d one.",
        "In a dramatic twist on last season\u2019s national championship game, Jalen Hurts came off the bench to pass for one touchdown and run for another in the fourth quarter, rallying No. 1 Alabama to a 35-28 win over No. 4 Georgia for the Southeastern Conference title Saturday.\nHeisman Trophy favorite Tua Tagovailoa had to be helped off the field with just over 11 minutes remaining after one of his own linemen stepped on the quarterback's right ankle as he attempted to throw.\nEnter Hurts, who led Alabama to the national title game as a freshman but lost the starting job to Tagovailoa. Hurts calmly guided the No. 1 Crimson Tide (13-0) to a game-tying touchdown with a 10-yard pass to Jerry Jeudy, capping a 16-play, 80-yard drive that consumed more than 7 minutes .\nAfter No. 4 Georgia (11-2) was stuffed on a fake punt near midfield, Hurts took matters into his own hands for the winning score. Spotting an opening up the middle, he took off on a 15-yard TD run with 1:04 remaining .\nThis was a reversal of the storyline from last season's national title game, when Tagovailoa replaced an ineffective Hurts at the start of the second half with Alabama trailing Georgia 13-0. The replacement threw three touchdown passes, including a 41-yarder in overtime that gave the Tide a stunning 26-23 victory.\nTagovailoa won the starting job in preseason practice and performed brilliantly during the regular season, throwing 36 touchdown passes with only two interceptions.\nThe SEC title game took a different path. Georgia put quite a beating on Tagovailoa, who was picked off twice, spent much of his spare time in the medical tent and was largely ineffective as the Bulldogs built a pair of two-touchdown leads.\nThis time, it was Hurts who bailed out the Crimson Tide. When he trotted off the field after the winning TD, Tagovailoa was one of the first ones to greet him on the sideline . Afterward, they stood side-by-side on the podium in the middle of the field while Alabama received its SEC championship trophy.\nNow, the Crimson Tide is headed back to the College Football Playoff, looking for its second straight national title and the sixth of the last decade under Saban.\nGeorgia can make a pretty good case for the playoff, too, but the Bulldogs will likely get left out. Big 12 champion Oklahoma avenged its only loss by beating Texas, and No. 6 Ohio State still had a chance to make its case in the Big Ten title game.\nThis was another galling loss for Saban's former assistant, Kirby Smart. He's quickly built Georgia into a national powerhouse, but he keeps coming up short against his ex-boss.\nFor the second time in about 11 months, the Bulldogs squandered a double-digit lead to the Crimson Tide. While this one didn't end with the suddenness of that national title game, it hurt just as bad. They had had another chance to knock off the team that had been No. 1 in the polls all season, a team that has built perhaps the greatest rivalry in college football history.\nGeorgia's Jake Fromm threw for 301 yards and three touchdowns, while Tagovailoa was only 10 of 25 for 164 yards. The Alabama quarterback had a pair of interceptions, matching his total for the entire season, though he did spark the comeback with a 51-yard touchdown pass to Jaylen Waddle late in the third quarter, cutting Georgia's lead to 28-21.\nHurts took it from there.\nThis was the sort of challenge that should serve the Crimson Tide well in the College Football Playoff. The Crimson Tide had not been in serious trouble all season, beating everyone by at least 22 points, but they showed plenty of grit when finally challenged by the Bulldogs. Alabama was outgained in total yards (454-403) and dominated in time of possession (Georgia held the ball for more than 35 minutes), but Saban's team found a way to do what it does better than anyone: win.\nThe Bulldogs will be kicking themselves for the way they let this one slip away. Twice, on third-and-short with a chance to extend drives, they failed to convert. The fake punt was a baffling decision \u2014 a direct snap to backup quarterback Justin Fields, who looked like he wanted to throw, took off running and didn't come close to picking up the first down. That gave Alabama a short field to work with on its winning drive.\nThe Bulldogs are hoping to land a playoff spot but will likely have to settle for a trip to the Sugar Bowl as a consolation prize.",
        "I became a mother before I fully grew into my own skin. I was nearly 17 years old when I had my first baby, and everyone was wearing crop tops that year. Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera displayed their taut midriffs in hit music videos. The poster for \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d featured a single red rose over a smooth, flawless belly. Friends would complain about their slightly protruding bellies; they thought they were fat. Me, I had a mom belly. Clearly plump. Zero definition. Stretch marks ran along my sides, deep and dark, altering the color and texture of my skin forever. If you put a picture of my belly next to that \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d poster you\u2019d think you were looking at bodies from different universes. Whatever universe my body snuck out of, I wanted to beam it back.\n\u201cUgh, I feel fat,\u201d my mom frequently complained. She taught me just how complicated and uncomfortable \u201cfat\u201d can be. I learned it the same way first words are learned, not from explanation but from context and repetition. I wonder how many times she had to complain in front of a mirror, or while squeezing into her jeans, for me to understand all the subtleties of feeling fat.\nIf you feel full, you feel fat. If you feel lazy, you feel fat. Sweaty, also fat. If your clothes are a little tight it means you are fat and you end up throwing an adult tantrum about it\u2014no one wants to leave the house feeling fat. If the curves of your body don\u2019t align with society\u2019s ideals, if just one curve bends slightly out of place, you\u2019re fat. My new post-pregnancy curves were misaligned, and I could feel it.\nMy friends would try to reassure me\u2014just as they did each other\u2014that I wasn't fat. But the objective truth was that \u201cfat\u201d perfectly described my body at the time.\nDuring my pregnancy I gained 62 pounds. After my son was born I was around 40 pounds heavier than I was pre-pregnancy. That might not seem like a whole lot, but I stand just shy of 5 feet tall and all that weight didn\u2019t have much real estate to choose from. Even five extra pounds can cause my clothes to fit awkwardly; 40 made me look like a completely different person.\nIt bothered me that she lied. It didn\u2019t ease my mind to know it was only to spare my feelings. It hurt because just thinking that my feelings needed protection from the word \"fat\" only reinforced the notion that \"fat\" was something I should feel bad about, that I should feel ashamed.\nAll I wanted was for one person to say, \u201cYes, you\u2019re fat, but that\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d I wanted my reality acknowledged. I wanted to be told my body was OK: fat, loose skin, buried belly button, stretch marks, and all. I begged a few friends, as well as lovers, to just tell me the truth. \u201cI know I\u2019m fat, just say it. I won\u2019t be mad.\u201d Not one of them took what they thought was bait. They just looked at me, with pity in their eyes, and lied.\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not fat.\u201d \u201cYou just had a baby.\u201d They said everything they could to try to make me feel better, but nothing that was loving toward the way my body really was.\nOf all the things my friends said to me the worst was, \u201cYou\u2019ll lose the weight.\u201d Every time I heard those words, I felt completely alone. My friends couldn\u2019t understand how much my body really changed. It wasn\u2019t as simple as losing the weight; I\u2019d still have loose skin and stretch marks. My body would never be the same and I knew it. But my friends hadn\u2019t yet examined society's standards and their responses were only a well-intentioned extension of all the messages the media fed us all.\nThe media was screaming at me to \u201cget back\u201d to my pre-pregnancy body as soon as possible. I wasn\u2019t supposed to accept or embrace the changes that came with carrying a life inside me. As if the \u201cmom body\u201d isn\u2019t a natural and normal body type but a deviation from what a real body is supposed to look like.\nI told myself I would never be attractive. I thought about how I would never be able to look back fondly at pictures from my teen years and say, \u201cI used to have a nice body.\u201d I thought I\u2019d never be able to wear a bathing suit without feeling uncomfortable, or \u201cfat.\u201d And I was supposed to just accept all of this shame instead of accepting myself. Accepting it all as a valid sacrifice for my baby, instead of questioning why my body couldn\u2019t be labeled as attractive.\nBy the time I was 18 I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight, but not shape. This is when I lost hope that my body would ever hold an idealized shape.\nLosing that hope was the best thing that ever happened to me. It meant I could stop trying to lose weight. It meant I could stop dreaming of a body that never was. It meant mourning the body I never had, a necessary step to accepting the body that was.\nLoving ourselves can only come when we strip societal judgments from words like \u201cfat\u201d and describe our bodies accurately, and with acceptance. It didn\u2019t happen overnight for me. Honestly I don't even know if I\u2019m there yet.\nI became pregnant with my third child a few years ago. It had been more than a decade since I had last been pregnant. This time, I chose to embrace the metamorphosis.\nI fell in love with my pregnant shape and when I gave birth to my third child and had my first shower after delivery, I cried as I washed my belly\u2014not because I felt fat, but because I felt empty. I looked at the linea nigra, the vertical brown stripe some women get on their belly when pregnant, with love and acceptance, worried that it would fade before I was ready to let go. I was sentimental about my body. I wanted to linger in the changes, remembering the details of each shape my body held. But I also wanted to embrace what was to come, never holding on to a shape that no longer fit me.

        "After an Iranian official said that the Islamic Republic's athletes would play \u201cevery country\u201d at the Olympics, it seemed the London Games would put a halt to Iranians boycotting events to avoid facing off against Israelis.\nBut the question of whether Iran and Israel will compete head to head is up in the air again after an Iranian news agency linked to the government reported that the official had been misquoted earlier this week.\nDucking out of events to make a statement is frowned on by the Olympics. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, warned earlier this summer that athletes who bowed out of competition without a good reason would face sanctions.\nBahram Afsharzadeh, secretary-general of the Iranian Olympic committee, seemed to swear off any boycott in his remarks. \u201cWe just follow the sportsmanship and play every country,\u201d Afsharzadeh was quoted as saying by the Associated Press and other outlets Monday.\nThe Associated Press noted that at times, Afsharzadeh had been speaking through an interpreter. In Iran, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported Tuesday that his words had been twisted, saying that Afsharzadeh had never named Israel in his remarks.\nThe debate may be a purely symbolic one: Iranian athletes are unlikely to face Israelis in competition at all, with the two countries sending few Olympians in the same categories, according to Israeli media.\nAn Iranian judo practitioner who might have faced an Israeli in competition, Javad Mahjoub, is reportedly missing the Games due to gastric illness -- a withdrawal that some have eyed suspiciously. In the past, Mahjoub told Iranian media he had deliberately lost a match to avoid facing off with an Israeli.\nThe International Olympic Committee said it was impossible to know at this stage whether any of the countries' athletes would face each other, \"as it will depend on qualifiers during the Games.\"\nIn several countries across the Middle East, Olympians have faced pressure to sidestep competing against Israeli athletes as a political statement. Some Iranian athletes avoided matches with Israelis by withdrawing from events at the Olympics in 2004 and 2008, according to the Associated Press.\nThe Olympics come at a time of continuing tensions between the two counties: Iran and Israel have long been at odds over Iran's disputed nuclear program, which Iran says is solely for peaceful purposes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has blamed Lebanon-based Hezbollah and its Iranian backers for a recent bombing targeting Israeli tourists in Bulgaria, an allegation Iran has denied.",

        "Government agencies are seeking broad new authority to ramp up killings and removals of gray wolves in the Northern Rockies and Great Lakes, despite two recent court actions that restored the animal's endangered status in every state except Alaska and Minnesota.\nVarious proposals would gas pups in their dens, surgically sterilize adult wolves and allow \"conservation\" or \"research\" hunts to drive down the predators' numbers.\nOnce poisoned to near-extermination in the lower 48 states, wolves made a remarkable comeback over the last two decades under protection of the Endangered Species Act. But as packs continue to multiply their taste for livestock and big game herds coveted by hunters has stoked a rising backlash.\nWildlife officials say that without public wolf hunting, they need greater latitude to eliminate problem packs. Montana and Idaho held inaugural hunts last year but an August court ruling scuttled their plans for 2010.\n\"As the wolf populations increase, the depredations increase and the number of wolf removals will increase. It's very logical,\" said Mark Collinge, Idaho director for Wildlife Services, the U.S. Department of Agriculture branch that removes problem wolves, typically by shooting them from aircraft.\n\"You just have to accept that part of having wolves is having to kill wolves,\" he said.\nBut wildlife advocates and animal rights groups contend the response to depredating wolves has become too heavy-handed. They say a string of court decisions in their favor underscores that the species remains at risk.\n\"The draconian lengths they are poised to take really are a throwback, to when the same agency was gassing wolf pups in their dens almost a century ago and setting poisoned baits and trapping them,\" said Michael Robinson with the Center for Biological Diversity.\nAt least 1,700 wolves now roam Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. There are more than 4,000 in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. New populations are taking hold in Oregon and Washington, and wolves have been sighted in Colorado, Utah and New England.\nSome of the most remote wilderness habitats are becoming saturated with the animals. As a result, packs are pushing into agricultural and residential areas where domestic animals offer an easy meal.\nOne of the more extreme proposals -- burying wolf pups in their dens and then poisoning them with carbon monoxide gas -- would be used only infrequently, in cases where the rest of the pack had been killed for preying on livestock, officials said.\nMore established practices, including shooting wolves from the air and ground, would be expanded.\nIn Montana and Idaho, officials hope to revive hunting seasons by rebranding them as \"conservation hunts\" or \"research hunts.\" Also, Montana Democrat U.S. Senator Max Baucus wants ranchers to have more freedom to shoot wolves harassing livestock.\nA novel, non-lethal approach to wolf control is being considered in Idaho, according to a Department of Agriculture proposal. After being surgically sterilized, pairs of wolves would be radio-collared and released -- \"to maintain and defend their territory against other wolf packs that might be more likely to prey on livestock.\"\nKilling marauding wolves is nothing new in some parts of their range: In the Northern Rockies, more than 1,400 have been killed by wildlife agents and ranchers since the first 66 wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho in the mid-1990s.\nBut Wisconsin and Michigan in the past avoided wolf killings, instead relocating plundering animals or taking defensive measures such as fencing in livestock. Under applications pending with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the states want new authority to remove up to 10 percent of their wolves annually, equal to about 110 wolves a year.\nGovernment statistics back up critics' claims that wolves account for a small proportion of livestock losses caused by predators. They kill fewer sheep and cattle than coyotes, bears, mountain lions or even dogs.\nYet where packs get onto ranchlands, the results can be brutal for both wolves and livestock. That was illustrated in a string of recent cattle killings and reprisals outside the small town of Ennis, Mont.\nSince late July, at least six ranches near Ennis have suffered cattle killings by a wolf group known as the Horse Creek pack, which lives at the base of the Gravelly mountains.\nWithin two weeks of the first calf being killed, wolf specialists with Wildlife Services killed two adult members of the Horse Creek pack in hopes of deterring the others.\nOne was shot on July 29 and the second on Aug. 6 -- just a day after U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy in Missoula, Mont. ordered the region's wolves back onto the endangered species list.\nAfter the attacks continued and several more calves died, state officials on Aug. 12 ordered the entire pack removed. Another calf was found dead on Aug. 13, and two on Aug. 17.\nTwo more Horse Creek wolves were shot.\nOn Aug. 18, three more calves turned up dead, bringing the total dead livestock to at least a dozen.\n\"When we authorize it, we're confident they're going to get it done,\" she said.\nRancher Jerry Dickinson said the Horse Creek pack killed at least three calves worth a combined $2,400 on the Granger ranch, which he manages.\nTheir carcasses were found on the Beaverhead National Forest, where the calves had been grazing. Others have disappeared without a trace.\n\"If they take that pack out, we've bought ourselves maybe two or three years until another pack establishes itself,\" Dickinson said. \"Eventually another bunch of wolves will move in there and we'll get the same problem all over.\"",
        "Principal of Candido Consulting Group, focused on helping businesses achieve optimal employee performance.\nIt\u2019s no secret that the annual review stirs anxiety among employees as well as their managers, who usually dread its tediousness and potential for confrontation. Yet despite being widely documented as ineffective and demotivating, the annual review remains a continued practice with changes over the years made only to the format and tone.\nWhat it really needs is an actual overhaul.\nToday\u2019s reality is that, for the first time in history, any given company may have multiple generations working alongside each other, with millennials influencing as much change on policy and procedures as their boomer predecessors did.\nThese differences bring their own challenges, especially when older workers may find themselves reporting to someone younger. In addition, the increased pace of modern business has led to new and rapidly changing roles, making the traditional annual review an antiquated exercise, at best.\nThanks to the digital age we have all come to expect instant responses. And having grown up in an era of \u201cinstant gratification\u201d from social media, instant messaging and text, millennials and their younger counterparts are especially more likely than older workers to require constant feedback and more frequent check-ins.\nWhile managers have long been encouraged to provide regular feedback and periodic check-ins, what actually makes feedback meaningful is when it\u2019s given in a timely manner. Employees benefit more from in-the-moment praise for a successful achievement, while immediate coaching for a \u201cteachable moment\u201d provides a stronger learning opportunity, regardless of age.\nA more formal structure may include a weekly or monthly meeting with each employee to discuss their progress, performance and their developmental needs. Other programs may be less formal but, in all cases, they should keep to the spirit of frequent and regular \u201ccoaching\u201d rather than evaluating, with the focus being on the employee and what they need to succeed.\nWhile all generations value communication, each has a different opinion on what is the best way to communicate. For example, older employees tend to prefer face-to-face interaction while young people tend to favour digital communication.\nGenerally speaking, preferences should be taken into consideration, but when it comes to performance-related communication, this is still best done face-to-face (or video conference calls for remote workers).\nMost employees appreciate a tangible expression of their worth to the company, demonstrated by your time and full attention. This also helps provide more certainty that feedback was clearly received through body language and other visual cues that could provide useful positive \u2013 or even negative \u2013 insight.\nThat said, feedback should never flow in one direction only. Managers need to build trust with two-way dialogue that encourages the exchange of candid feedback, so employees feel comfortable sharing ideas. Save the digital communication for sending out timely meeting summaries and confirmation of next steps.\nJust because something was always done a certain way doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s how it has to be done now. There\u2019s a new kid on the block, literally. Compared with older generations, who were more concerned with tenure and loyalty, millennials are more likely to change employers often and therefore will want specific feedback that relates to their career progression.\nSo, while \u201chow you can help the company\u201d may resonate with older workers, it means little to the younger ones. In this case, think about how you can shift the conversation to opportunities for growth and development and demonstrate how they can achieve their career objectives. Be clear on the competencies required for success and be prepared to discuss how you can help them further develop them.\nWorking together to set goals that actually have meaning to the employee, as well as the business, will help with motivation, engagement and retention, while encouraging ownership of their own development. Hence, some companies are shifting to a more supportive system of frequent coaching that focuses on the future, rather than dwelling on the past.\nWhile a mechanism for providing feedback and supporting the merits of a raise, promotion or even termination are still necessary, to think that the annual review and one style of process works across the board just doesn\u2019t make sense. Instead, design for a more flexible performance system that can be tweaked, and that provides frequent and better opportunities to engage and grow employees in an efficient and meaningful way.",
        "A Russian Su-24 takes off on a combat mission at Hemeimeem airbase, Syria, on Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.\nFor a mere 3 minutes on Tuesday, the American and Russian militaries worked as one.\nIt happened during a rare joint military \"communications test\" in which one warplane from each side flew within five miles of each other in the skies over south central Syria, U.S. Defense Department spokeswoman Commander Elissa Smith toldMashable.\nThe joint training comes after the U.S. and Russia on Oct. 20 signed an agreement that regulates aircraft and drone flights over Syria. Known as the memorandum of understanding, it outlines \"a set of rules and restrictions aimed at preventing incidents between the Russian and U.S. aviation,\" according to Russia's defense minister, Anatoly Antonov.\nAs part of the deal, the countries' militaries are required to use specific communication frequencies and create a communication line on the ground.\nThe exercise essentially was a test to ensure Russian and American planes don't collide in mid-air, Smith said in an email.\nRussian Colonel-General Andrei Kartapolov deemed the exercise a success, according to the Interfax news agency. He said the crews of the Russian Air Force and the international coalition \"established a relationship ... in the Russian and English languages.\"\nThis photo made from the footage taken from Russian Defense Ministry official website on Monday, Nov. 2, 2015 shows a target hit during s Russian air raid in Syria.\nRussia's campaign of airstrikes in Syria that began in September has led to dangerously crowded skies over the country. The development has prompted fears that an incident involving American and Russian warplanes could spark aggression between the nuclear powers.\nThere have been several close calls in the last month. Russian warplanes on two occasions flew within 500 feet and 1,500 feet of U.S. aircraft. American military pilots were reportedly warned by commanders after the incidents to be careful not to react to the Russian fly-bys.\nU.S. official say Russia has made no effort to coordinate its airstrikes to avoid potential incidents.\nTensions between the two countries over Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine were already at their worst since the Cold War before Russia entered the Syrian war. The Department of Defense suspended all military-to-military cooperation with Russia after Crimea, which remains in effect. Therefore, Smith insisted that Tuesday's drill was a \"test\" and not an exercise.\nMoscow's action in Syria, where its military is propping up the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and fighting anti-government militant groups, including some backed by the U.S., has put more strain on its relationship with Washington.\nThe war in Syria, now in its fifth year, has cost the lives of over 225,000 people and displaced millions more, spawning an unprecedented flight of refugees to Europe.\nThe world's top diplomats and major foreign players, including rivals, involved in the war met for the first time in Vienna on Oct. 30 to discuss a political solution. The same group will meet again later this month.",
        "The following interview with Texas State Representative Rodney Anderson is one of a series of interviews conducted by VOCES Action and TexasGOPVote with members of the Hispanic Republican Conference in the 82nd session of the Texas Legislature. Rep. Anderson is a member of the Texas House of Representatives representing District 106, which includes Grand Prairie, Irving, and part of Dallas. Rep. Anderson is a freshman in the House of Representatives. We had a good conversation where he shared with me why he decided to get involved in politics.\nDistrict 106 is composed of a majority of minorities. Rep. Anderson explained how he spent 6 months getting to know the community, knocking on over 15,000 doors during his campaign. The people of his district are concerned about three issues: jobs, illegal immigration and taxes.\nRep. Anderson explained why he joined the Hispanic Republican Conference and also his participation in two House Committees, Economic and Small Business Development and Land and Resource Management.\nAdryana Boyne: We're glad to be here with Representative Rodney Anderson from the Dallas area. Representative Anderson, thank you for agreeing to give us an interview today.\nRodney Anderson: Thank you for having me.\nAdryana Boyne: Well we know that you are really busy in this session, but we just want to take some time so that people can get to know you. First of all, I would like to ask you if you can tell us a little bit about your background and how you chose to enter politics.\nRodney Anderson: Well I am a lifelong resident of Grand Prairie, I was born and raised there, and after a lengthy discussion with friends and family, I made a decision on my own to go ahead and run for state representative. My wife and I had talked about running for school board or city council or something like that. On December 31st, I went to pay my property taxes, and I asked myself the question, am I getting my money's worth? The answer to that to me was no, and so I went to the Dallas County Republican Headquarters, and said I'd like to file to run for office, and they kind of looked at me like who are you, where'd you come from, and that's how it came about. I'd never been involved in city politics, I'd never been on school board, city council. It was just something that I'd made the decision, was I getting my money's worth and the answer was no. That's why I ran.\nAdryana Boyne: Certainly one thing that we noticed in your district is that it's made up of a majority of minorities. Can you tell us a little bit about your district and what led to your election as representative of your district?\nRodney Anderson: I am a little unique in that I am a Republican that represents a district that is 50% Hispanic, it is 15% African American, and 5% other. We're a 70% majority minority district, and a lot of my success I attribute to being actively engaged with my entire community, not just the Anglo population. We spent a great deal of time over a 6 month period knocking on doors, attending from various groups, parades, events that we put on, campaign events, but the majority of it was done door-to-door. I was not one of these candidates that was financed by large groups. We received some outside money, but I'm not a wealthy individual either. Grand Prairie is a blue collar suburb that knowing the people that I represent, it was a complete surprise to beat the mayor, the mayor's son, who was in that seat, and we did it by knocking on almost 15,000 doors over a 6 month period of time. Every Saturday, every Sunday, we were out in the community talking to people. They'd be in their front yards, or they'd be gardening, washing their car, or they'd just be out having fun, and we would talk to them and say what do you like, or what do you not like about government, and then we'd let them talk from there, and find out what they'd really want, what they're concerned about, and it was that personal touch, I think, that led to my election.\nAdryana Boyne: Mr. Anderson, you are talking about knocking on people's doors in the time of your campaign, can you tell us a little more about what the peoples' responses were and what were their main concerns?\nRodney Anderson: The first thing they were surprised about was that it was actually a candidate knocking on their door because most candidates don't do that, but their biggest concerns were, this cut across all ethnic makeup, Hispanic, African American, White, it didn't matter, it was jobs first, illegal immigration was second. I didn't run across any person that has any problem whatsoever with a much broader immigration policy, but everyone is concerned with illegal immigration. So it was jobs, illegal immigration, and then taxes, please do not raise taxes because most people can draw the correlation that if you raise taxes on businesses, if you raise taxes on individuals, less money is going to go into the economy, which means since 75% of our budget is sales tax, raising taxes on businesses causes them to cut jobs. If you raise taxes on individuals, they stop spending, and it becomes a downward spiral, but those were the three main topics.\nAdryana Boyne: It's interesting, as a National Director of VOCES Action, I deal a lot with what is the moral and fiscal values, but since I'm a Hispanic, they ask me a lot about immigration and illegal immigration, and certainly, would you mind to briefly explain what is your opinion on what could be a good solution to fix the problem of illegal immigration, certainly we know that there are people in both extremes, and I would like to know a little bit about where you stand on that?\nRodney Anderson: You are right, there are people on both extremes, and I am one that tends to look at it, I had someone that is a Hispanic man say what we need to have is we need to have very high walls, but very wide gates, and when we talked about it, it made perfect sense. We as a country need to know the people that are here. If people want to come here, I am all for it, come on, with a guest program or a broader visa program that allows people, the Statue of Liberty says, \"Give me your tired your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breath free, send these, the homeless, the tempest, tempest-tost to me.\" That's what it says, and it greeted immigrants from all over Europe. Well now it's like there are some people that don't want any immigration, and then there are some that want everybody to be here, regardless of, and no we can't have that. It is a two-pronged issue, number one, we have businesses here that are hiring people illegally and taking advantage of the people that they shouldn't be taking advantage of. I have a real, real problem with any business that does that. Those businesses that do that, should be fined out of existence. Number two, we have people though that want to come here that don't want to come here legally, that don't want to wait in line. I can't exactly say that I blame them when the line is 8,9,12 years down the road. We have to broaden our immigration program to where we can accept more people in that want to work her, that want to become citizens, that if they want to serve in our military. If they want to do those things, I am all for it. We have to approach it from both sides. If you have the demand for workers, which goes squarely back to companies, if you have that demand, the supply will be there, and so we have to attack both sides of that equation.\nAdryana Boyne: Why did you choose to be part of the Hispanic Republican Conference here in the House?\nRodney Anderson: When Aaron Pena invited me, he said you qualify, do you want to join, I said absolutely. He said your district is not such that you can be a voting member. I said wait until the census data comes out because over the last ten years, the Hispanic population in Grand Prairie and South Irving has exploded. It's gone from 28-29% to where it is now almost half, it's 49.9% to be exact, and so now I am a voting member of the Hispanic Republican Conference, and as soon as Aaron asked me, I said absolutely because again, the growing Latino population, we as Republicans have to reach out to them, we have to because if we don't, again through the state of Texas, Latinos are going to be the largest portion of the population, and what I have found, and when I sit down with Latinos is that most of them are conservative by nature, they're very hard working, they're very pro-family, the majority are Catholic. That is a conservative voter, but we as the Republican Party haven't done a very good job of reaching out to say this is who we are, you're the same way, we just happen to have a different skin color, and I think that's one reason I can relate to people. I can sit down and have a conversation with someone who's not Anglo, and I'm not talking down to them, I look at them as they're people just like me. They go to a job, they work, they want to take care of their family, and so when Mr. Pena asked me if I wanted to be a part of the Hispanic Republican Conference, I said absolutely, without question.\nAdryana Boyne: Well certainly we are excited about that. Now I know that you are a freshmen in the House, but certainly you are already busy, especially in the committees that you are involved in. Can you tell us a little bit about those committees that you are involved in?\nRodney Anderson: I was very fortunate, one of the committees that I requested to be on was the Economic and Small Business Development because I'm a small business man. I work for a company called Commerce Title, and they have been very good about allowing me to be down here to work. I'm not an attorney, but I'm a small business man. The bills that come before our committee involve everything from the governor's enterprise fund of how to best use that to Texas Workforce Commission issues. The second is Land and Resource Management of being in the title business. One of the biggest bills that we have taken up so far is the eminent domain bill, one of the governor's emergency items, and with my title background, it fit very, very well with that. I was actually able to help create language within the Senate Bill to make sure that the by back provisions didn't create problems for the public record, and those are the two committees that I've been on, in addition to the Hispanic Republican Conference.\nAdryana Boyne: I'm from North Texas, from Denton County, Highland Village, Tan Parker is my State Representative.\nRodney Anderson: I know exactly where Highland Village is, I used to run a title company up in Flower Mound and Lewisville. We had an office in Denton, so I know exactly where Highland Village is.\nAdryana Boyne: I want to thank you for not only serving your district but for serving all Texans. Thank you very much.\nRodney Anderson: Thank you so very much. It's a pleasure.",
        "Who Was in Kiev\u2019s Independence Square?\nNow that Viktor Yanukovych has gone, and new elections are promised, we need to assess the political and popular forces that succeeded in overturning Ukraine\u2019s political system. Who were the protesters and what were their goals? At the barricades in central Kiev there were Ukrainian and EU flags, as well as portraits of the poet Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), considered as a spiritual father of Ukrainian identity, and of Stepan Bandera (1909-1959) who was, depending on your point of view, either a great patriot or a Nazi collaborator. And there were pictures of five Ukrainian activists, treated as martyrs after they were killed during the clashes in Grushevsky Street.\nMaidan Nezalezhnosti, Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, the epicentre of the protests that had been taking place across Ukraine for three months, was filled with tents pitched by sympathisers from every part of the country: from Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk, the strongholds of nationalism, but also from Lugansk and Donetsk, the big cities of the industrial east, which have always felt close to Russia. Cossacks wore their traditional costume. Women brought black bread and ham to the men standing guard. There was a pervasive smell of tea, cabbage soup and wood fires. During the week, the few thousand activists went about their day-to-day business; on Sundays, tens of thousands came to hear speeches by opposition leaders, pray and sing the national anthem, tirelessly.\nThe protest movement emerged in November last year, after Yanukovych suspended negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union (1). Independence Square was gradually transformed. The first to arrive were a few thousand pro-European partisans, but as repression began the square became a symbol of revolt against a corrupt and mercenary political system for many others \u2014 initially a revolt against the Yanukovych system, but also a rejection of the opposition parties, out of their depth in this crisis.\nThe involvement of several nationalist groups \u2014 a small but highly visible presence \u2014 and of ultra-radical, non-democratic movements without European sympathies has produced different reactions. Their presence was used actively by Russia, and to some extent by Yanukovych\u2019s government, to discredit the movement. But it also raised fears of a possible takeover of Independence Square by the far right \u2014 even though a popular movement was behind the protests and any attempt to categorise it in political terms would be an over-simplification.\nThe far right is largely modelled on the nationalist movement that developed from the 1920s, when most of what is now Ukraine was divided between Poland and Soviet Russia. From the start it was shaped by a variety of influences: Italian fascism, the partial collaboration \u2014 for pragmatic or ideological reasons \u2014 of some of its representatives (such as Bandera) with Nazi Germany, the participation of several Ukrainian battalions in the massacre of Jewish and Polish civilians during the second world war.\nPolitical scientist Andreas Umland, who teaches at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said: \u201cThere are no objective historical accounts of Bandera\u2019s [career]. Russian historians portray him as a fascist ally of the Nazis, while Ukrainian historians praise him without reserve. His admirers on Independence Square take a na\u00efve and biased view of him, which is a problem. But it seems equally biased and dishonest to call him a fascist, as the Russians do\u201d (2).\nDormant during the Soviet era, the nationalist movement reappeared after independence in 1991, when the Social-National Party of Ukraine (SNPU) was formed. Until the early 2000s, the SNPU was a marginal, xenophobic and ultra-nationalist organisation, and what little support it had was largely in the west of the country. Its leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, was elected to the Ukrainian parliament for the first time in 1998.\nIn search of respectability, Svoboda established relations with other European far-right parties. Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of France\u2019s Front National, attended the 2004 congress as guest of honour. Svoboda also moderated its nationalist stance and references to Bandera \u2014 about whom Ukrainians do not agree \u2014 and gradually adopted a more general discourse, relatively common among the European far right, based on radical and vehement criticism of \u201cthe system\u201d.\nThis did not prevent Tyahnybok from making statements that recall his xenophobic and anti-Semitic roots. In 2004 he declared that the Ukraine was governed by a \u201cJewish-Russian mafia\u201d, which led to his exclusion from the Nasha Ukraina (Our Ukraine) parliamentary group. In 2005 he wrote an open letter to the president, demanding that he \u201cput an end to the criminal activities of Ukrainian Jewry\u201d.\nAt the parliamentary elections in 2012, Svoboda won nearly 10.5% of the vote and 37 seats in parliament. With more than two million votes, it became a party of national importance, achieving significant results in parts of the country other than the west, which is traditionally more receptive to nationalism.\nSvoboda, \u201cprobably on the advice of [France\u2019s] Front National\u201d, according to Andreas Umland,has also drawn up an economic programme with a social dimension. This would renationalise a number of enterprises, introduce progressive taxation on business profits, and seek to reduce the dominance of the oligarchs over the political and economic systems. These measures, together with the promise of a vigorous campaign against corruption, have attracted some categories of voters, especially small businessmen and members of the middle class, who have been particularly affected by the crisis and by nepotism, which has increased since Yanukovych was elected.\nA number of initiatives under Yanukovych\u2019s presidency have irritated voters keen to defend the Ukrainian language and identity. They include a law on regional languages that came into effect in summer 2012 and allows regions that wish to do so to make Russian their second official language, or to reduce Ukrainian language-teaching in schools, as it is \u201cunnecessary\u201d, according to the education minister, Dmytro Tabachnyk.\nThough re-centred, Svoboda is still anchored in the far right. Its lead policy is the strengthening of Ukrainian national identity, which implies an end to Russian influence. On the foreign policy side, this translates into a wish to see Ukraine join NATO, rearm with nuclear weapons and leave all post-Soviet cooperative organisations.\nAmong Svoboda\u2019s domestic priorities is \u201cde-Sovietisation\u201d: purging or sidelining former SNPU cadres and KGB agents, changing street and place names, removing monuments to heroes of the Soviet Union. Svoboda also proposes to abolish Crimea\u2019s autonomous status and promote Ukrainian national identity through measures ranging from systematic glorification of the nationalist movement to reintroducing the mentions of religious affiliation and ethnicity on identity documents.\nSvoboda wants to see Ukraine join the EU. This pragmatic change of stance is inspired more by the tactical necessity for a \u201csacred union\u201d with other opposition forces, and by electoral goals, than by a sincere desire to join, though Svoboda does also see the EU as a way of keeping Russia at a distance.\nThe party has also tried to disassociate itself from anti-Semitism, to the point where Joseph Zisels, chairman of the Association of Jewish Communities in the Ukraine, assured me that \u201cSvoboda presents no threat to Jews. Their real enemy is the Russians. \u2026 It\u2019s true that it\u2019s the only major party to take Bandera andShukhevych (3) as its heroes, which I admit is awkward, but for all that it is not anti-Semitic.\u201d This has not prevented a few slip-ups, for instance when Svoboda MP Igor Miroshnichenko in November 2012 denied that US actress Mila Kunis had Ukrainian roots, saying that she was in fact a jidovka, an ambiguous Ukrainian slang word meaning a person of Jewish faith or ancestry.\nSvoboda has been highly visible in Independence Square \u2014 it controlled Kiev city hall, occupied until 16 February \u2014 but ultimately has little influence over the demonstrators, as is the case for other opposition parties. This political void, coupled with the violence used by the authorities over the past few weeks, culminating in a pitched battle, has created conditions favourable to the emergence of new groups, whose style and ideological stance have raised many questions.\nThe biggest, Pravy Sektor (right sector), emerged after the Grushevsky Street clashes and, for the moment, enjoys real popular support. It has a few thousand members across the country, including people disappointed by Svoboda, members of ultra-nationalist groups, hooligans and dropouts. Their common denominator is a taste for radical action, and for the ideology that one of the movement\u2019s leaders, Andrei Tarassenko, dispensed from its high-security headquarters on the fifth floor of Trade Union House, on Independence Square. Pravy Sektor defines itself as \u201cneither xenophobic nor anti-Semitic, as Kremlin propaganda claims\u201d and above all as \u201cnationalist, defending the values of white, Christian Europe against the loss of the nation and deregionalisation\u201d. Like Svoboda, it rejects multiculturalism, as \u201cresponsible for the disappearance of the crucifix and the arrival of girls in burqas in your schools\u201d, but it does not advocate joining the EU, which it describes as \u201cliberal totalitarianism in which God has vanished and values are turned upside down\u201d.\nPravy Sektor supports none of the opposition parties, especially not Svoboda, disappointed by its \u201cappeals for calm and negotiation with the authorities\u201d. It could contemplate becoming a party itself, which would be awkward for Svoboda\u2019s Tyahnybok: besides seeing his reputation as an anti-system champion seriously dented by his appeals for moderation during the clashes, he would have to come to terms with a party even further to the right, whose feats of arms and determination are known.\nSvoboda\u2019s success over the past few years and the presence of neo-fascist groups such as Pravy Sektor in Independence Square are signs of a crisis in Ukrainian society. It is first and foremost a crisis of identity: in 22 years of independence, Ukraine has not managed to develop an unbiased historical narrative presenting a positive view of all its regions and citizens: even today, the Ukrainians are seen as liberators in Galicia but as fascists in Donbass. It is also a political crisis: some Ukrainians, exasperated and disappointed with the Orange Revolution (4), have turned to voting for extremist parties, more out of pique than for real ideological reasons. Though Independence Square will go down in history as an extraordinary example of collective and popular action, the political outcome is as yet unclear. Ukraine is in need of a new force that truly serves the people and transcends its many social and political divides.\nEmmanuel Dreyfus is an international relations consultant specialising in the former Soviet Union.\n(1) See S\u00e9bastien Gobert, \u201cUkraine caught between EU and Eurasia\u201d, Le Monde diplomatique, English edition, December 2013.\n(2) See Andreas Umland, \u201cUkraine, Russia and the EU\u201d, Le Monde diplomatique, Diplomatic Channels, December 2013.\n(4) See Vicken Cheterian, \u201cRevolutionary aftershocks in the East \u201d, Le Monde diplomatique, English edition,October 2005.",
        "From the mountains of Kashmir to the forests of central India and the troubled towns of its remote northeast, troops are on the streets in a major security crackdown ahead of Independence Day celebrations.\nIndia celebrates the 60th anniversary of independence from British rule on Wednesday, a day traditionally marked by violent attacks by separatists or Maoist rebels, and security forces are on their highest level of alert in many areas.\nIn New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will unfurl the national flag from the ramparts of the historic Red Fort on Wednesday morning to a 21-gun salute, and then address the nation in a speech expected to laud six decades of progress.\nBut about 1,400 km (900 miles) away in the remote northeast, separatists in the oil- and tea-rich state of Assam have already killed 30 people since Wednesday, including women and children, all of them Hindi-speaking settlers.\nThe army has intensified patrols and aerial surveillance of Assam's hills and forests, while armed police have mounted roadblocks outside the major towns and even conducted house-to-house searches in some areas.\nPolice say more attacks are planned, with reports guerrillas have sneaked into Assam's main city Guwahati and other towns from hideouts in neighboring Bangladesh and Myanmar.\n\"We have enough intelligence inputs suggesting the militants are out to create trouble before and on August 15,\" a senior police officer said on condition of anonymity.\n\"They might also target prominent political leaders to create a fear psychosis among the people.\"\nThe United Liberation Front of Asom has been fighting for independence of ethnic Assamese since 1979 and accuses New Delhi and non-Assamese people of plundering the state's resources and ruining its culture.\nIn the capital New Delhi and the financial centre of Mumbai, both of which have been frequently targeted by gunmen, police deployed additional forces and stepped up monitoring traffic entering the cities, authorities and witnesses said.\n\"We don't want to be complacent. We are ready to face any challenge,\" said P.S. Pasricha, police chief of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital.\n\"With the current scenario in the country... we take everything seriously.\"\nLife has once again been seriously disrupted in Kashmir by a security crackdown, with unpopular \"cordon and search\" operations and frisking of civilians stepped up.\n\"Our locality has witnessed four search operations in the past six days. It is disturbing our daily routine,\" said schoolteacher Bilkees Khan, adding that Independence Day and January's Republic Day \"only bring misery to us\".\nKashmiri separatist groups have called for a general strike on August 15, calling it a \"black day\" and the celebrations \"meaningless\" until Kashmir got freedom from Indian rule.\nIn eastern India, Maoist insurgents have distributed leaflets in towns and villages asking people to boycott the celebrations.\nThousands of police have been deployed to guard railway stations, airports and government buildings as well as power plants and factories in the region.\n\"We are very careful this year and have dozens of plainclothes policemen traveling in trains and buses looking for anyone suspicious,\" said Raj Kanojia, a top police officer. Additional forces have also been deployed along India's porous border with Bangladesh, with border guards frisking people in border towns to stop fighters from sneaking in.\nBut despite the threats, most of the country is expecting to celebrate the holiday in peace.\nColorful lights have been installed on the streets of Kolkata, and paper flags put up along railings and overhead.\n\"Amidst all the trouble and violence, August 15 is a day to celebrate and I am partying outside the city with friends,\" said computer engineer Amit Chatterjee.",
        "Relationship and mentoring startup IDIRUS was founded over a year ago by Irish entrepreneur Niamh Bushnell. Bushnell, formerly of Irish government agency Enterprise Ireland and Orbiscom (acquired by MasterCard) was also the founder of New York based boutique consultancy firm MarketSprint. Bushnell has been living in the US for 15 years and mentors aspiring entrepreneurs at New Jersey based non-profit Rising Tide Capital.\nCompanies can use IDIRUS according to Bushnell, to optimize their internal talent, encouraging their employees or members to train, coach and mentor each other. Participants present their skills, interests and goals and are matched either directly or through a facilitator.\nThe idea for starting this company came through Bushnell\u2019s interactions and work with lots of Irish tech companies entering the US market.\nAccording to Bushnell all of these companies and entrepreneurs were facing the same challenge - how to get access to high level decision makers in the US.\nWhat kind of changes did the company/product go through in early stages?\nWe\u2019re always changing as we learn from our clients, enhancing our technology and trying new things. Since the very early days we\u2019ve used market feedback and usage metrics to evolve our product. Change is incremental rather than at a frenetic pace but it\u2019s a component that\u2019s absolutely critical for a company\u2019s survival in the early days and for growth from there.\nDo you have investors? Are you looking for further investment?\nWe\u2019ve been generating revenue for the last two quarters which has allowed us to run our business as well as learn as much as we can about the market and the potential for our company prior to seeking funding. We\u2019re getting much closer now to a time when investment will be important to accelerate our growth.\nWhat kind of growth has your company experienced?\nWe now have 6 clients and steady revenue but we\u2019re still an early stage company that\u2019s busy growing our team, deepening our understanding of the market and improving our product.\n6. The Irish ones include Enterprise Ireland, Northern Ireland Connections and our newest client - Boardmatch Ireland. We also work with Wayra (Telefonica) across Europe and have two early stage corporate clients here in the US who are public, Fortune 1000 companies.\nTell us about your industry: What was it like to break into?\nWe\u2019re in the Human Capital Management (HCM) business which is experiencing a lot of upheaval and new opportunities right now. HCM professionals are looking for new ways to achieve their goals and are very interested in using technology as an enabler. So, connecting with key leaders and getting some initial traction for our work was not difficult and it\u2019s a super exciting space to be in right now.\nWhat's the biggest challenge you've faced so far? The greatest victory?\nI think the biggest challenge for small companies, us included, is that feeling of isolation in an otherwise very crowded and noisy world. You really have to love what you\u2019re doing and believe in it to start up and maintain your focus. Not every day is a great or successful day but every day can bring you one step closer to achieving something great.\nIn terms of our greatest victory - I\u2019m proud of the client base we\u2019ve been able to attract to date and I really love our redesigned product that\u2019s just launching!\nWhat's been the most important lesson?\nWhat are your plans for 2014?\nWe\u2019ve a couple of very important pilots happening this year so one of the major milestones for us will be making sure they are successful and lead to bigger projects within our established client base. Other than that, this year is all about more clients and more success metrics for the product.\nWhat are your immediate next steps and long-term goals?\nImmediate is as above. Our longer term goal is to be the leading private peer employee matching platform globally.\nWhat international markets do you foresee the company expanding into?\nWe\u2019re already working across Europe, and Latin America would be an interesting market for us when the time is right. Our main focus today is US or Irish based companies with global offices so we\u2019ll have people across 5 continents using our tool very soon.\nWhat advice do you have for other people/companies starting out in your industry?\nCome talk to me and I\u2019ll be happy to make some introductions for you!\nScaling for us is about clients and investment and both are a priority in the second half of 2014.\nWho do you think are your customers?\nOur customers are companies with 500+ employees who want to match up those employees for learning, networking, mentoring, career development and knowledge transfer.",
        "After Tornadoes Hit In And Around New Orleans, Wall Of Storms Moves East : The Two-Way The National Weather Service says multiple tornadoes touched down in southern Louisiana on Tuesday, and severe weather moving east threatened other Southern states.\nA wall of dangerous storms is moving across the South, threatening communities in their path with high winds, severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes.\nThe National Weather Service warned of severe thunderstorms and hail along the Mississippi coast and issued a series of rapidly updated tornado warnings for parts of Louisiana and Mississippi.\nThe NWS New Orleans Office is updating its Twitter account here with information for the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nThe governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, declared a state of emergency after severe storms moved through the southeastern part of the state.\nEarlier Tuesday, the National Weather Service confirmed that multiple tornadoes touched down in and around New Orleans. The website for the electricity utility in New Orleans, Etergy, showed that more than 15,000 customers had lost power.\nNew Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu told The Associated Press that dozens of people reportedly suffered minor injuries, and a spokesman for the city's Emergency Medical Services described those injured as \"walking wounded.\"\nEshon Trosclair holds her son Camron Chapital on Tuesday after a tornado tore through while they were inside their home in the eastern part of New Orleans. The National Weather Service says at least three confirmed tornadoes touched down, including one inside the New Orleans city limits.\nAt 11:33 a.m. CT, the NWS office for New Orleans tweeted, \"Dangerous tornado on the ground in New Orleans East.

        "Chance, in the course of a verse, a song, or an album, always seems to be stretching toward something new, something else.\nThe third mixtape by Chance the Rapper, \u201cColoring Book,\u201d begins with the sound of a trumpet. Soon subtly harmonized, the horn (played by Chance\u2019s constant sideman and alter-ego, Donnie Trumpet) teeters between controlled and offhanded play, tumbling almost accidentally into short, congested melismas. The impression is of an excited warmup, less an announcement than the happy hurry that precedes one. In this way, the trumpet is a kind of synecdoche for Chance\u2019s ramplike gift: in the course of a verse, a song, or, here, the ecstatic whole of an album, he always seems to be stretching toward something new, something else. Chance is a funny, earnest, off-kilter lyricist, but his real power\u2014this ability to always be building\u2014rises from a level far beneath text. \u201cColoring Book\u201d is, above all, a showcase for its creator\u2019s preternatural understanding of the elements that make up a mood.\n\u201cAll We Got,\u201d the horn-led first song of \u201cColoring Book,\u201d feels like a sequel to \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d and not only because it is another collaboration with West. As the trumpet gives way to the crack of a drum machine, Chance vamps for a while, quietly sharing his version of domestic bliss: \u201cTryna turn my baby mamma to my fianc\u00e9e / She like music, she from Houston like Auntie \u2019Yonc\u00e9.\u201d Then, suddenly overtaken by love, he starts to bellow: \u201cMan, my daughter couldn\u2019t haaave a better mooother! / If she ever find another, he better love her / Man, I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it / If I die, I\u2019ll probably cry at my own service.\u201d Meanwhile, the horn honks keep coming, and when Kanye enters, auto-tuning the song\u2019s chorus (\u201cThis is all we got / Isn\u2019t this all we got? / So we might as well give it all we got\u201d), he\u2019s accompanied by sped-up samples of gospel hollers, the signature stylistic tic of his early beatmaking career. This is appropriate: just as West is Chance\u2019s encouraging big brother and cheerleader (just the other day, on Twitter, he enthused, \u201cChance too good. God level bars\u201d), West\u2019s first album, \u201cThe College Dropout,\u201d is a kind of mentor text to \u201cColoring Book,\u201d especially in its insistence on a kinship between gospel and rap. But where Kanye\u2019s devotion has always resembled the near-mystic inwardness and complexity of John\u2019s Gospel, Chance is more like the apostles of Acts: he relentlessly, almost compulsively, evangelizes and invites.\nThe breadth of references in \u201cColoring Book\u201d helps this attempt at inclusion along. At the end of \u201cBlessings,\u201d Chance injects snippets of the gospel artist Fred Hammond\u2019s 1998 hit \u201cLet the Praise Begin\u201d: \u201cAre you ready for your blessing? / Are you ready for your miracle?\u201d Hammond is from the same generation as Kirk Franklin, a similar artist who has succeeded with young, semi-secular audiences, using the same genre-bending approach to composition and style. Chance\u2019s nod in Hammond\u2019s direction, and his showcasing of Franklin in the second half of the B-3 organ propulsed \u201cFinish Line,\u201d later in the tape, is an approving adoption of their strategically open arms. \u201cHow Great,\u201d a cover of Chris Tomlin\u2019s anthemic \u201cHow Great is Our God,\u201d knowingly extends church music\u2019s fluid movement between races and denominations. Songs by white artists like Tomlin and Hillsong (the musical arm of an Australian megachurch) have often been reinterpreted by black choirs, reversing the earlier exchange that gave birth to non-denominational \u201cworship\u201d music\u2014the incorporation of the harmonic and rhythmic innovations of gospel acts like the late genius Andra\u00e9 Crouch into the basic structures of pop-folk and arena rock. By including and cross-fertilizing so many distinct but related expressive modes, Chance adds yet another layer to this centuries-old interplay, ever so slightly widening its focus.",
        "Demonstrators in Polish cities have raised an outcry over judicial reforms amid a toxic media campaign.\nThe largest protests were in Warsaw, where 10,000 people, according to city authorities, assembled outside parliament and outside the supreme court on Sunday (16 July).\nThousands of people also assembled in other cities, including Katowice, Krakow, Lodz, Opole, Poznan, Szczecin, Torun, and Wroclaw.\nPeople lit candles around court buildings in what they called a \u201cChain of Light\u201d.\nThey also carried signs and chanted slogans which accused the ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), and its leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, of turning Poland into a \u201cdictatorship\u201d.\nThe demonstrations came after PiS extended its control over Poland\u2019s judiciary by passing two bills in the senate on Friday.\nThe first one lets the government pick 15 out of 22 judges on the National Council of the Judiciary, which supervises judicial ethics. The second one lets it appoint district and appeals court judges.\nThe laws still have to be signed by Polish president Andrzej Duda, but he is loyal to Kaczynski.\nA third bill, to be debated in parliament on Tuesday, would also let PiS appoint supreme court judges.\nPoland was already under European Commission scrutiny after the Kaczynski government installed loyalists in the country\u2019s constitutional tribunal.\nThe behaviour of Polish state media also showed to what extent they have fallen under PiS control.\nTVP, a national broadcaster, accused the Polish opposition of trying to organise a violent coup on Sunday.\n\u201cLow turnout in front of Sejm despite Gregorz Schetyna\u2019s call for putsch\u201d it said in a red banner over its images of the Polish parliament, referring to the leader of the Civic Platform opposition party.\nTVP also attacked an individual journalist, Dorota Bawolek, from the Polsat broadcaster, who is based in Brussels, for having asked what it called \u201cprovocative\u201d questions in an EU Commission press briefing on Thursday.\nThe TVP accusation prompted abuse against her on Twitter after she asked the Commission for a comment on the judicial reforms.\nThe Committee for the Defence of Democracy, an NGO, helped to organise Sunday's rallies, which were attended by members of the Civic Platform and Modern opposition parties.\nThe NGO used similar rhetoric to TVP, saying on its website that people had to \u201cStop the Coup d\u2019Etat!\u201d.\n\"Today we know that a great fight has begun and we know we must be together, we know we must fight against them together,\" the Civic Platform\u2019s Schetyna told a crowd in Warsaw on Sunday, the Reuters news agency reported.\nKaczynski told press on Friday that the Polish judiciary needed \u201cfar-reaching, radical\u201d reforms because it had suffered a \u201ccollapse of moral principles, professional morality, general morality\u201d.\nHe also said courts suffered from \u201chuge inefficiency, delays in cases, which cause many people to suffer\u201d.\nAn EU spokesman last Friday indicated that Frans Timmermans, the Commission's deputy head, would speak out on the developments in Poland this week.",
        "A rusty gun which is believed to have been used by legendary artist Vincent Van Gogh to kill himself is to be sold at auction for the first time.\nOn July 27 1890 the Dutch painter was shot in the stomach in northern France and he died two days later.\nIt is thought he was shot by himself or by an unknown enemy.\nThe 7mm Lefaucheux revolver was found 75 years later in a field near the village of Auvers-sur-Oise where the artist was staying - and investigators believe it was the weapon used to shoot him.\nDrouot, the Paris auction house, are organising the sale in June and have estimated the rusting weapon's price at as up to around \u00a350,000.\nForensics investigators have proved the gun dates back to the 1890s and have described it as the 'most infamous gun in the history of art' - because Van Gogh was only 37 at the time, and could have carried on painting for years.\nIt also explained in the statement that the gun was a 'low power' weapon, possibly explaining why Van Gogh did not die instantly.\nThe revolver going under the hammer in Paris was part of a 2016 exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam but this is the first time it's going under the hammer.\nThere were no witnesses to the tragedy, which took place in a wheat field or a barn in the French village of Auvers-sur-Oise, 20 miles north of Paris.\nThe single 7mm bullet did not hit any internal organs, and the artist was initially able to get back to his guest house, the Auberge Ravoux, where he smoked his pipe and chatted with his brother, Theo Van Gogh.\nBut doctors were unable to remove the bullet, and Van Gogh's last words were: 'The sadness will last forever'.\nVan Gogh predicted he would have a longer life than he did despite his deteriorating mental health.\nThe weapon was found by a farmer in fields that Van Gogh loved to paint.\nThe fields were where he spent the last months of his life, and was displayed at the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam up until 2016.\nThe farmer later gave the weapon to the owners of the Ravoux Inn in the village.\nThe family who own the inn are now offering it for sale.\nIt has belonged to the French family since its discovery.\nVan Gogh's death remains a matter of historical debate, with some arguing that he shot himself.\nVan Gogh, who severed his own ear with a razor in 1888, is buried in Auvers-sur-Oise, alongside his loyal brother, Theo.\nA book by Pulitzer-Prize winning authors has questioned that version of the painter's death, concluding that Van Gogh was shot by two teenagers.\nMartin Bailey, a Van Gogh expert, said he though that the revolver is 'very likely' the gun used by Van Gogh, but says he 'cannot be certain'.\nHe added that he hopes it will be bought by somebody who is responsible and not be 'displayed as a gruesome relic'.\nAccording from an accounts from Adeline Ravoux, whose parents owned the Inn, Van Gogh went to the inn for breakfast and dinner after working in the fields.\nShe said on the day that he was shot he returned to his room around 9pm clutching his stomach and told her father that 'he had tried to kill himself' when he asked him what was wrong.",
        "When you're enjoying your extra hour in bed Sunday morning, spare a thought for what that 60 minutes might cost.\nWhile some dislike the seasonal shifts of Daylight Saving Time (DST) for the minor inconvenience to their sleep cycles and busy schedules, there's a more serious side to the scheme: the loss of an hour of afternoon sunlight when it ends\u2014as it does this weekend\u2014may increase the likelihood of traffic accidents.\n\"Darkness kills and sunlight saves lives,\" said University of Washington Law Professor Steve Calandrillo, who has studied the effectiveness of different DST policies. \"The question is 'when do you want sunlight?'\"\nFor Calandrillo, who advocates for DST to be implemented throughout the year, the answer is simple: more people are active during the evening, including kids, and the additional sunlight that DST provides helps provide drivers with the visibility necessary to see pedestrians. \"At 5 pm virtually everyone in society is awake,\" he said. \"There are far more people asleep at 7 in the morning than at 7 in the evening.\"\nIn addition to leading to poor visibility in darkness, some experts say the requirement for people to abruptly adapt to a time change overnight may lead to dangerous driving. \"Even though it\u2019s dark, you\u2019re still behaving like it\u2019s light,\" said Lawrence University economist David Gerard, of the first weeks after a time change. People may drive faster, he said, and pedestrians may be less attentive.\nAdvocates of perpetual DST have some statistics on their side. Adding an hour of sunlight in the evening year-round would save the lives of more than 170 pedestrians annually, according to a 2004 study in Accident Analysis and Prevention. The lives of nearly 200 vehicle occupants would also theoretically be saved by the change.\nBut despite this data, some child advocacy groups such as the National PTA have argued for more sunlight in the morning hours when children will be traveling to school. In 2005, the group opposed bringing DST forward into March from April. \"People who take their kids to school in the morning, they kind of like Daylight Saving Time,\" said Gerard. \"They can deal with [darkness] at the end of the day, but in the morning it\u2019s tough getting going.\"\nBoth advocates and opponents of DST can agree, however, that better light equals greater safety \u2014 which is why some child safety advocates say that communities need to focus on providing better artificial street lighting, regardless of whether it's used in the morning or evening. \"The more visible kids are,\" said Margaux Mennesson, a spokesperson for the group Safe Routes to School,\"the safer they are.\"",
        "We were in Seattle, sitting around my son\u2019s table after a sumptuous meal.\n\u201cKate, I have a question for you about languages,\u201d declared Jesse, a Canadian and a sensitive law student (yes, they really do exist).\n\u201cWhat kind of question?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYou mean like in \u2018A Fish Called Wanda?\u2019\u201d I laughed.\n\u201cOh, you mean gender,\u201d I replied.\n\u201cActually,\u201d I went on, \u201cI don\u2019t think they think of it in terms of male and female. I know words in Spanish for certain body parts that you would think must be \u2018male,\u2019 but are \u2018female,\u2019 and vice versa.\nTwo days later, Jesse came over to my son\u2019s house to do some painting.\n\u201cHey, Jesse, I have an idea, but don\u2019t take it as gospel. It\u2019s only a theory backed up by zilch,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnimism,\u201d I repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny coincidence, but I\u2019ve been doing some reading about it. Apparently, so-called \u2018primitive\u2019 tribes that developed in an environment where food and water were plentiful and survival was relatively easy tended to be animistic. That is, they had a great variety of natural gods and goddesses and believed that everything in nature was alive and in cooperation. You know, the Druids worshipped trees; Native Americans had animal gods.\n\u201cInteresting, if a bit out there, but what\u2019s your point?\u201d Jesse asked.\n\u201c\u2018Were\u2019 is the right word,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat I think is that after centuries, as these tribes developed into the \u2018civilized\u2019 countries and their languages developed into the modern languages, the original reason for assigning gender was lost while the grammatical device of gender was retained.\n\u201cSure, it sounds good and all,\u201d I said.\nThe above conversation took place some eight months ago.\nJesse, this follow-up is for you.\nThese kinds of ideas also make an appearance in other biblical documents. Probably, then, Aramaic, the language of Jesus, made use of gender.\nNot having any way of checking out Aramaic, I decided that modern Arabic might be a good indicator for my theory.

        "Destined to fail: Is taking the job no one wants ever a good thing?\nSo is it ever worth it to take the job no one else wants??If something doesn't pass the smell test, stay away. And if you do, be ready for what's coming.\nThey're posted on company job boards, listed on online career websites and passed along by word of mouth between friends, peers and co-workers. And while they offer potentially attractive salaries, good benefits and unending challenges, there are numerous job openings that share one current trait: No one wants them.\nRecent events in Donald Trump 's White House highlighted the difficulties in filling jobs that are deemed impossible. The difficulties the president had when looking for a new chief of staff certainly mirror the process of filling other job openings throughout the country, specifically when those close to the position know that the job itself will be one that could cost them their personal and professional reputation.\nPaul Nelson, a software sales manager in New Brunswick, New Jersey, says he knows all about trying to fill a job considered impossible by his co-workers. Nelson, who asked that his real name not be used, considered himself the \"last man standing\" for the manager of his previous employer's sales group, which was responsible for selling inventory software to small and midsize firms. \"Anyone who was even remotely qualified for the job left the company or refused to toss their hat into the ring,\" says Nelson, 43. \"I was 38 at the time with three kids so I decided I could use the extra salary. I figured it couldn't be that bad. And I knew what I was getting into. And still, I thought I could handle it.\"\nWhat Nelson was \"getting into\" was a job that, according to him, required an almost cult-like devotion to the company's CEO. \"I figured I'd kiss up and just deal with it but it turned out to be much more difficult,\" he says. \"I was expected to basically sell everyone else out. I was supposed to be the insider who dished all the dirt on the other managers, and I just couldn't do it.\"\nStill, it's not that he didn't try. \"I played the game for a few months when he'd ask about a certain person but I'd just pitch in small stuff, like 'oh, he's late every once in a while but he's a good guy,' small stuff like that,\" Nelson says. \"But our CEO, who took over the company to sell us off but then decided he could be the next Steve Jobs and wanted to re-do everything we'd already done, was determined to find out who was saying negative things about him and negative things about the company. It was too much.\"\nNelson says he finally had enough when one of his co-workers called him Dwight, as in Dwight Schrute from the TV show \"The Office,\" who would sell out his office mates in a heartbeat to gain points with his boss, Michael Scott. \"I'm a huge 'Office' fan and that one hurt,\" he says. \"I know he was joking, kind of, because everyone knew what I'd gotten myself into, but it did make me think.\"\nIn fact, it made Nelson think enough that he gave his two-week notice three days later. \"It was a sinking ship anyway and I had been looking for a new job so it wasn't like I did this noble thing,\" says Nelson. \"But it did feel good to tell him that I quit. And the 'Dwight' thing pushed me over the edge.\"\nFor many, the breaking point with a job usually comes from the boss and not his or her peers. \"I think people snap a bit when they get called out and humiliated in front of their co-workers, who, let's face it, are their friends,\" says Theresa Hecht, a career adviser in Tampa, Florida. \"People have to suffer some humiliation at some point in their life but no one likes to be ridiculed in front of others. That's the top reason I hear when people tell me that they left a job or refused to accept a promotion.\"\nRebecca Harrison, a retired HR director, says if she had been honest with herself, she would have come to the same realization before she accepted her final job as the hiring manager for a group of boutique hotels located in Minneapolis, St. Paul and Rochester, Minnesota. \"I'd seen my future boss rip people to shreds during meetings. I'd even watched him berate his wife in front of one of our hotels one day without any thought of the people walking by or me, who was standing three feet away. Those are bad signs, right? But sometimes, you see a few extra dollars and a better title and you convince yourself that you'll be the one to figure it out. And guess what, you won't,\" Harrison says.\nHecht agrees. \"It's a lose-lose situation, most of the time,\" she says. \"I tell people you either ruin the job or the job ruins you, and in most cases, you're the one who gets ruined.\"\nSo is it ever worth it to take the job no one else wants?\n\"That's up to the individual,\" says Hecht. \"But be ready for what's coming. If something doesn't pass the smell test, stay away.\"\nGood advice, Harrison says. \"I quit after three months,\" Harrison says. \"I was 61 at the time and I took early retirement. I still feel foolish for taking the job in the first place. I mean, when you know a job is going to be bad, like it's right there in front of you, and you ignore all the signs, you kind of deserve it.\"",
        "Taking a room full of furniture, accents and accessories and making it look like it all belongs together may seem difficult, but it can be done. Check out these tips to learn how to tie a room together.\nTying a room together doesn\u2019t mean having to spend a lot of money or buying several new items for the room. In most cases, you can tie a room together successfully with the furniture and accent pieces you already have, by displaying them properly. Or you can add one or two new items that will make the room \u201cpop.\u201d Here are some secrets to tying a room together.\nUsing items that you have collected \u2014 through your travels, as family heirlooms or items that you just love \u2014 is the perfect way to tie a room together. Choose a few key items that suit the room best, paying attention to size, color and theme. The items do not have to all match each other, but the size of the accent pieces should reflect the scale of the room and furniture, and the collectibles should either be in a similar color grouping or contrasting colors that don\u2019t clash. Don\u2019t try to display all your collectibles in one room, however \u2014 just choose a few special pieces and place them around the room in key places.\nOne beautiful item that reflects the theme or colors of a room can tie the room together, like a large painting over the fireplace or in the focal point of the room. Make sure the room theme and colors are reflected in the painting and the subject of the painting, as well as in the frame. For example, if your room has a country feel to it with soft blue, cream and yellow tones, you\u2019d want to choose a painting with these colors, in a light oak, pine or white frame.\nUsing one type of fabric for accent pieces that match the tone and color of your room can tie everything together. Choose a fabric in a color or pattern that will complement your room and create accent pillows, small tablecloths for end tables or even lampshade covers using this fabric. These small touches can bring together a room with different colors and furniture pieces and make it feel like a finished room.\nDecorative area rugs are another excellent way to pull a room\u2019s decor together. Place one under the coffee table in the sitting area between the sofa and accent chairs or under the dining room table to tie the room\u2019s colors together in that space. Blend the colors from the area rug with the room through the colors of the drapes, curtains or walls. A decorative area rug can bring a room together and give it a warm, cozy feeling.",
        "IOWA CITY, Iowa \u2014 A black University of Iowa student lied about being the victim of a hate crime and was actually an aggressor during several drunken fights that began inside a bar, police said Tuesday.\nMarcus Owens, 19, told police that he was attacked in an alley April 30 by three white men who hurled racial slurs and beat him, damaging his eye socket, knocking out his front teeth and cutting his lips. The claim stoked safety concerns and exposed minority students\u2019 distrust of university leaders.\nBut a two-week investigation by Iowa City Police found that a heavily intoxicated Owens was an instigator during several altercations that began inside the Eden Lounge early May 1 and continued in downtown streets.\nPolice said Tuesday that Owens would not face charges for filing a false report, fighting or underage drinking, and that they would not seek restitution to recover the costs of their investigation. They said they wanted to avoid lengthy court proceedings in the case that shook the normally quiet college town.\n\u201cIt became clear at some point that the community, not Marcus, was the victim in this event and it was important to us to get the truth out there,\u201d said Capt. Troy Kelsay, who called Owens a \u201cliar\u201d at a news conference.\n\u201cI think the outcome for all is fair,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Owens may face university sanctions. University President Bruce Harreld said the school would provide \u201csupport and assistance\u201d to all involved. A university spokeswoman said Iowa is investigating whether students violated the code of conduct; the outcome will be confidential.\nInvestigators said the fighting was sparked by a disagreement between students from different fraternities, including one where Owens was a pledge.\nBar surveillance video showed a suit-wearing Owens among a large group of people shoving each other inside the bar at 1:32 a.m. Owens pushed and punched another person outside the bar entrance minutes later.\nA bar employee removed Owens and stopped him when he tried to re-enter the premises. Owens and his friends later \u201cbeat the snot out of\u201d a person who had called another man a racial epithet, Kelsay said. That attack was also captured by a surveillance camera.\nOwens later grabbed and attempted to punch another person, police said. The two fought on the ground, and that\u2019s when Owens was injured, police said.\nOwens received treatment at a hospital, where a blood draw showed he was still intoxicated three hours later. The next day, he made his report to police.\nHarreld said the case had been difficult for the university.\n\u201cRegardless of the outcome, this incident highlighted a level of fear and distrust on our campus that must and will be addressed,\u201d Harreld said.",

        "President Trump deserves credit for agreeing to meet with a delegation of frustrated and emotional survivors of the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Given his all too cozy and politically motivated alliance with the National Rifle Association, he was caught between the students\u2019 demands for tighter gun restrictions and his supporters\u2019 concern about sliding down the slippery slope of Second Amendment infringement.\nAt the end of the \u201clistening session,\u201d Trump followed the NRA playbook. He offered up the gun lobby\u2019s rather minor concessions \u2014 banning bump stocks and maybe raising the legal age for purchasing a high-powered weapon of mass murder destruction from 18 to 21. You could probably count on one hand the total number of mass killings over the past three decades that those changes might have affected.\nStill, these are beneficial baby steps that can hopefully be embraced by lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including those in the GOP (which should be renamed the \u201cGun Owners Party\u201d).\nNot so palatable, and that\u2019s putting it mildly, is Trump\u2019s suggestion that we arm as many as 20% of our nation\u2019s school teachers \u2014 concealed carry for educators. Supporters of firearms-for-faculty maintain that ever since the early 1990s, when Congress established schools as gun-free zones, an armed assailant, be it a student\u2013insider or a stranger\u2013intruder, could be assured of facing little or no opposition. Maybe Johnny wouldn\u2019t be so quick to bring a loaded gun to school if he knew that teachers and administrators were packing heat.\nHowever, rather than a deterrent for someone who himself may be prepared to die, this could actually be an incentive. Johnny, long feeling obscure and disrespected, might believe he could become a big man on campus by shooting it out with the deputy principal at high noon in the school cafeteria.\nTrump has shown a tendency to think that many of his borrowed ideas and pronouncements are original. But in this case, as with bump stocks and raising the legal gun purchase age, he is simply promoting the NRA agenda. Just days after the December 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting, the powerful gun group announced its interest in funding a National School Shield Program, an effort to provide every school in America with armed guards, including retired police officers and trained volunteers. Although the NRA failed to see its dream fulfilled, several states have in recent years enacted bills to allow licensed teachers to keep their weapons locked and loaded while at school.\nWhat level of training is sufficient so that we can trust a teacher\u2019s judgment and accuracy when suddenly confronted with a calm and heavily armed assailant? And exactly what type of guns would be permitted for the faculty that could compete against an intruder wielding a high-powered assault rifle and toting enough ammunition to turn the school corridor into a shooting gallery?\nRather than equipping schools with armed guards, be they volunteer marksmen or teachers with a passion for guns, maybe Trump would like to propose that big, beautiful walls be erected around the perimeter of every school. That would cost billions, but maybe Trump could convince Mexico to foot the bill.\nI\u2019m not serious, of course. But I also can\u2019t take seriously the idea of turning educators into executioners.\nFor teachers, marksmanship should be about A\u2019s and B\u2019s. Not guns and ammo.\nJames Alan Fox is the Lipman Professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University and a member of the USA TODAY Board of Contributors.

        "Meg Whitman knows a thing or two about Herculean tasks. Sunday, she has a new one as HP splits in two.\nPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Meg Whitman knows a thing or two about Herculean tasks.\nAfter all, she did raise eBay from humble beginnings to help create an e-commerce powerhouse whose market capitalization is now $34 billion. She took on political legend Jerry Brown in an unsuccessful bid to become governor of California in 2010. And she ditched a successful career in venture capital to attempt to return an American business icon, Hewlett-Packard, to glory.\nShe apparently saved the most difficult challenge for last: Split HP into two Fortune 50 companies, each $50 billion behemoths that separately serve the PC and enterprise markets while competing with the likes of IBM, Oracle, Dell-EMC and other tech giants.\n\"We're turning around an icon ... that lost its way,\" Whitman, 59, says. \"We're trying to set the company up for the next chapter by laying the pipes and remodeling the house.\"\nOn Sunday, it becomes official with the formation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which will concentrate on selling hardware such as servers to businesses in need of building their data centers, and HP Inc., which will sell PCs and printers to businesses and consumers.\nUSA TODAY gained behind-the-scenes access to Whitman, who will run HPE, and other HP executives in the weeks leading up to the tech pioneer's historic split. Last week, this reporter sat in on an executive briefing at HP headquarters here, where Whitman, Chief Technology Officer Martin Fink, Chief Information Officer Scott Spradley and others met with start-ups and Hewlett Packard Ventures.\nAs arduous struggles go, the split is a multibillion-dollar doozy. HP is leaking tens of thousands of jobs, locked in a decades-long pitched battle with other behemoths and straining to regain its cultural identity.\nSome analysts have expressed skepticism about the split, announced a year ago. In a note, Bernstein Research warned of spinoff-related costs and weakened \"synergies\" between the two new companies. Some cite the spin-off of Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific testing and measurement gear considered HP\u2019s most innovative business, in 2000 as a misfire.\nWhitman, former vice president of strategic planning at Disney, who attained celeb status as eBay's hard-charging CEO from 1998 to 2008, acknowledges the challenge of reversing a horrific stretch of big deals gone sour (such as HP's troubled $10.3 billion acquisition of enterprise software company Autonomy in 2011) and a revolving door of CEOs before her (Carly Fiorina, Leo Apotheker, Mark Hurd). \"There were quite different strategies from the CEOs before me,\" she says. \"It's like ice skating, where you're in the middle of a group of people and being whipped around.\"\nHow ambitious is this split? Few in tech history have been attempted on this scale. It\u2019s tantamount to changing the engine on a car hurtling down a freeway without slowing down.\nThe newly constituted HP has the organizational chops to pull it off, Dutkowsky contends. He says Whitman and HP Inc. CEO Dion Weisler called him within minutes of announcing HP\u2019s split and quickly set up a program to smooth the business transition for Tech Data.\nCorporate moves leading up to the split suggest the two companies are on the right path, says Crawford Del Prete, an analyst at research firm IDC. They got out of some companies, like computer-security firm Tipping Point, and bought companies in cloud services. \"They\u2019ve done a great job of reducing internal costs and dividing up (how they sell products),\" he says.\nA September bombshell announcement that the technology behemoth plans to slash up to 30,000 jobs \u2014 roughly 10% of its worldwide workforce \u2014 underscores wrenching changes and an uncertain future for the Silicon Valley company.\nHP shares, meanwhile, have declined 24% over the past year, closing at $26.96 on Friday. Under the split, investors will be given both a stake in both HP Inc. (ticker symbol: HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE).\nHome improvement analogies aside, the market has changed, and HP needs to change with it, Whitman says. It also needs to regain the HP Way, principles that defined the 76-year-old company as a beacon of innovation, community service and progressive workplace that drew the praise of Steve Jobs and others.\n\"I'm more convinced than a year ago, when I decided to split the company,\" Whitman says.\nHP\u2019s official reason to split is to streamline its business and create two smaller, simpler companies. Like fellow legacy tech giant IBM, HP has seen its sales sputter as the market for PCs decrease while new rivals such as Amazon dominate emerging enterprise technologies like cloud computing.\nDell\u2019s proposed acquisition of data storage provider EMC for a record $67 billion boldly reflects the high stakes \u2013 and competition \u2013 HP faces in the battle for the $1 trillion IT market worldwide.\n\u201cUltimately, we view this deal as a wake-up call to traditional IT stalwarts (such as HP, Oracle, Microsoft and IBM) that they must finally use their massive treasure chests to be more aggressive on M&A\u201d Ives says.\nIt\u2019s all a bit like politics \u2013 of which Whitman knows a thing or two from her run as the Republican candidate for California's governor.\nA political junkie, Whitman doesn\u2019t support predecessor Fiorina in her bid for the Republican presidential nomination, but New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whom Whitman has known for years.\nAs for her own political aspirations? \u201cNo. That\u2019s definitive,\u201d Whitman says, without hesitation. \u201cI learned a lesson. It was the experience of a lifetime.\"\nWhitman's chore today is far from the state Capitol. She's overseeing the creation of two Fortune 50 companies, each saddled with some heavy recent history.\nHP's troubles long precede Whitman: It has spent $61.2 billion alone on eight big acquisitions since 1997, with mixed results.\nAcquisitions of Electronic Data Systems ($13.9 billion, under then-CEO Mark Hurd in 2008), Palm ($1.2 billion, Hurd, 2010) and Autonomy ($10 billion, Leo Apotheker, 2011) put a further strain on HP's operations, forcing massive write-offs and staff reductions.\nThe split, which HP estimates will cost it more than $2 billion, could undercut the synergy between the enterprise and PC operations in selling goods and services, according to an SEC filing by HP.\n\"It's an entirely different situation from eBay, based on the type of company, size and market,\" Whitman says. \"eBay was on fire, creating a new industry. HP was a very proud, iconic company.\"\nShe adds, \"What is the same is winning the hearts and minds of employees, and setting the right priorities for innovation and financials.\"\nMost days are a blur for Whitman. She pings from one event to another: A business review of the PC or server unit for an hour, customer meetings, meetings with employees, a quick check of the financial performance for the quarter, a look at next-generation products. The meetings are anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours and can be as varied as an equity road show for HPE with investors in New York or one-on-one meetings with investors in San Francisco, Los Angeles, London or Baltimore.\nAt HP headquarters here last week, HP provided rare access to a quarterly meeting, called Coffee with Meg (she drank tea), in which she huddled with other HP executives, members of Hewlett Packard Ventures and start-ups.\nAt an executive briefing room Thursday morning, they sat around a conference table and discussed packet-processing protocol technology, cloud-enabled mobile services, Internet-connected sensor systems, and supply-side security.\nFor 90 minutes, a laser-focused Whitman was attentive, laughed, joked with participants and asked technical and marketing questions.\nIf only the historic split is so easy.",
        "Faceoff: Should young people have wills?\nHome Advisor\u2019s Edge September 2013 Faceoff: Should young people have wills?\nDo twenty- and thirty-somethings need wills? Experts remain divided.\nWithout a will, assets must go through the probate process. That\u2019s an immediate cost to your client\u2019s survivors. And the estate lawyer\u2019s fees aren\u2019t always a percentage of the estate. Most lawyers charge fixed amounts, which could run into thousands of dollars.\nIn most provinces, if clients don\u2019t have spouses or children, their assets go to their parents. But some young people have siblings or friends with greater financial need. Some might also want to make charitable gifts. Plus, uncertainty around how to handle an estate puts bereaved family members through much more grief.\nThere\u2019s more to a will than listing who gets what. The document should specify who manages the estate after your client dies. If she has minor children, it should address guardianship and any trust funds. Your client should also draft power of attorney and healthcare directives in case of physical or mental incapacity.\nThe healthcare directive can specify where she will live (home, hospice, LTC, etc.), what her activities (hobbies, trips, day-to-day physical activities, etc.) will be, and who can visit her. In many provinces, a client can also address end-of-life wishes in the healthcare directive. She can specify the treatment she wants if she enters a vegetative state, or how long she would want to be on life support. Laws in most provinces specify that whoever you appoint must follow your wishes, regardless of what he or she may think is best.\nIf your client has special medical conditions, the directive could facilitate decisions about what kinds of treatments can be tried. She could also specify preferences for organ donation.\nDigital assets are also becoming part of estate planning [Editor\u2019s note: look for our article on this topic in the November issue of Advisor\u2019s Edge]. Our questionnaires ask about email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Dropbox accounts. Technically your client\u2019s executor would be in charge of her online identity, unless she specifies otherwise.\nWe recommend people keep a separate list with their usernames and passwords, list of bank accounts and safety deposit boxes, etc., and tell the executor or appointee how to find that list.\nOther unusual assets young people might wish to list in their wills are reward points\u2014anything that could potentially be transferred. They might wish to leave instructions about how to use biological material such as frozen sperm or eggs; these are sensitive issues, and the family could be left in a quandary without specific instructions from the testator. Writers, musicians and designers might also want to leave specific instructions about copyright and royalties.\nIn most provinces, people can draft legal wills once they reach the age of majority. However, those under 18 can have wills in special circumstances: if they\u2019re getting married or have high-risk jobs (e.g., military officer), or if the court approves a document for them. (People who travel to dangerous designations are often granted wills, regardless of age).\nTell clients it\u2019s time to think about wills as soon as they have anything in their names, such as bank accounts, RRSPs or TFSAs. Young people should also draft wills when they receive inheritances. If they have life insurance through work, they can name the estate as beneficiary and let a will govern the proceeds\u2019 distribution.\nIf your client moves outside Canada, review the will and make sure it is still valid in that country. Likewise, inheriting property in a foreign country will require checking which legal and tax regime applies.\nAs for an executor, suggest your client choose a responsible adult and consult him or her. If their relationship changes, she can change the executor at any point.\nRecommend she review her will every couple of years to make sure it reflects her most current situation and wishes. And encourage clients to create separate personal effects memos in which they mention all their valuables, such as jewelry, cars, boats, antiques, etc. Most wills I draft says the executor should distribute personal items in accordance with the memo. That way, the client doesn\u2019t have to get in touch with me for small changes, such as who gets the car or guitar.\nFor a healthy 22-year-old making $20,000 a year with no assets, spouse or kids, it seems excessively cautious to spend $200 on a will.\nWorse, the document might only just address where he would like to be buried or cremated, or to whom his almost non-existent personal possessions would go. He doesn\u2019t need an executor to carry out those wishes; he could just tell family and close friends. And if he\u2019s terminally ill, there\u2019s nothing stopping him from giving everything away before he dies, or drafting a will when the illness is detected.\nYoung people just starting out in jobs might have insurance policies at work. But it makes more sense to name a beneficiary\u2014rather than create a will just for the purpose\u2014as the benefits go directly to the beneficiary or the deceased\u2019s estate, and are not subject to probate or any other fees or taxes.\nSimilarly, you can name beneficiaries for registered accounts such as RRSPs, as well as TFSAs.\nRRSPs, much like insurance policies, pass directly to the designated beneficiary on death and are not available to creditors. For a TFSA, if the client names a beneficiary as a successor holder, the account continues to exist and the successor assumes ownership.\nAny income earned after that date continues to be sheltered from tax under the successor holder. The successor\u2019s unused TFSA contribution room also remains unaffected by additional ownership of the deceased holder\u2019s account.\nThe main purpose of a will is disposition of assets. If he doesn\u2019t have any, he doesn\u2019t need one. He may own things that aren\u2019t worth much but do have sentimental value that he wants to leave to a particular person. But with priceless treasures like these, it\u2019s OK to tell family and friends while alive.\nIf your client is worried about being physically or mentally incapacitated, it\u2019s better to draft a power of attorney, or what some people call a living will. Ontario has two kinds of living wills: one for assets, the other for physical care. That latter covers donation of body parts and tissues.\nYoung people should think of having a will when they get married, are in a common-law relationship, have children, or start acquiring significant assets, such as a home.\nA typical situation would be a young couple with kids and assets that aren\u2019t jointly held. One spouse may want to ensure that while the surviving spouse can have income from the assets, they should ultimately pass on to the kids.\nAs for DIY, the kits could have faulty directions or your client could misinterpret them, thereby making the will void.

Today, after three years of work, they join business and education supporters in unveiling a \u201csimulation and modeling\u201d computer tool designed to crunch vast amounts of data about students, teachers, and the workforce, and evaluate various mathematics and science education policies.\nCalled the \u201cU.S. STEM Education Model,\u201d the tool relies on complex algorithms and allows users to gauge the impact of policies while adjusting for more than 200 individual variables in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or \u201cSTEM\u201d education.\nThose variables include class size, teacher turnover, gender differences, and teacher salaries, as well as data from scholarly studies that have been put into the system. The tool is free and available for downloading online, though it requires simulation software.\nThe simulation-and-modeling tool, while complex, is meant to provide scholars, state and federal policymakers, and others with a way to study the effects of past, current, and future policies, said Brian H. Wells, Raytheon\u2019s chief systems engineer, who helped develop the system. Initially, it was meant to focus on how to increase the number of STEM college graduates, though it has clear applications for K-12 and the workforce, too, he noted.\nFor example, a recent test-run of the model examined a popular policy suggestion: that raising teacher salaries will draw more top-notch teacher-candidates to classrooms, as opposed to having them take potentially more lucrative jobs in the private sector. The model found that when businesses began losing well-qualified workers, they adjusted by raising salaries in an attempt to lure them back, which \u201ccounteracted\u201d the initial policy, Mr. Wells said. He cautioned that many factors in the model could be adjusted to produce a different result.\nRaytheon, a major defense contractor headquartered in Waltham, Mass., began developing the model three years ago under the direction of the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, William H. Swanson. The company assigned a team of engineers to work on it.\nIt released the model to the public at an event here today, at which time Raytheon also officially turned the tool over to the Business-Higher Education Forum, an education advocacy organization based in the nation\u2019s capital that represents business ceos and university and foundation leaders.\nAs policymakers across the country debate STEM education policy, the modeling tool attempts to nudge the discussion away from anecdotes toward data, said Brian Fitzgerald, the executive director of the Business-Higher Education Forum.\nThe modeling tool already includes data sets that allow for comparisons of the cost effectiveness and the overall impact of diverse policies aimed at encouraging more students to enter and stick with STEM studies and fields, Mr. Fitzgerald said. Those efforts include mentoring and social-networking programs.\nMr. Fitzgerald believes the tool will reveal that many policies for increasing the number of highly qualified K-12 and college students in STEM, and finding a place for them in the job market, are interconnected.\nClarification: The simulation model is officially known as the \u201cU.S. STEM Education Model.\u201d The original version of this story made reference to the STEM Research and Modeling Network, which is a network of business and education advocates working on the development and promoting the use of the model.",
        "We all know the Iranian M.O. \u2014 nuclear proliferation, Holocaust denial, threats to wipe out Israel, vicious anti-Western rhetoric, lavish sponsorship of terrorists at work attacking Israel and destabilizing Lebanon.\nIf that were not enough, we now learn that Iran has been sending agents into Iraq to destroy the fledgling democracy and supplying sophisticated roadside bombs to blow up Americans.\nLunatic state-run media keep boasting that Iran will kidnap American soldiers, shut down the Straits of Hormuz, send out global jihadists and raise the price of oil.\nMost international observers agree on two things about this loony theocracy that promises to take the world down with it: We should not yet bomb Iran, and it should not get the bomb. Yet the former forbearance could well ensure the latter reality.\nWhat, then, should the United States do other than keep offering meaningless platitudes about \"dialogue\" and \"talking\"?\nImagine that Iran is a hardboiled egg with a thin shell. We should tap it lightly wherever we can \u2014 until tiny fissures join and shatter the shell.\nWe can begin to do this by pushing international accords and doggedly ratcheting up the weak United Nations sanctions. Even if they don't do much to Iran in any significant way, the resolutions seem to enrage Ahmadinejad. And when he rages at the United Nations, he only loses further support, especially in the Third World.\nWe should start another fissure by prodding the European Union, presently Iran's chief trading partner, to be more vocal and resolute in pressuring Iran. The so-called EU3 \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 failed completely to stop Iran's nuclear proliferation. But out of that setback came a growing realization among Europeans that a nuclear-tipped missile from theocratic Iran could soon hit Europe just as easily as it could Israel. Now Europeans should adopt a complete trade embargo to prevent Iranian access to precision machinery and high technology otherwise unobtainable from mischievous Russia and China.\nAmericans should continue to support Iranian dissidents. We need not encourage dissidents to go into the street, where they could be shot. Instead we can offer them media help and access to the West. Americans can highlight the plight of women, minorities and liberals in Iran \u2014 just the groups that so appeal to the elite Western left.\nAnd we should announce in advance that we don't want any bases in Iran, that we don't want its oil, and that we won't send American infantry there. That would preempt the tired charges of imperialism and colonialism.\nThe United States also must stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan. The last thing Iran wants is a democratic and prosperous Middle East surrounding its borders. The televised sight of Afghans, Iraqis, Kurds, Lebanese and Turks voting and speaking freely could galvanize Iranian popular opinion that in time might overwhelm the mullahs.\nAt the same time, we need to remind the Gulf monarchies that a nuclear Shiite theocracy is far more dangerous to them than either the United States or Israel \u2014 and that America's efforts to contain Iran depend on their own to rein in Wahhabis in Iraq.\nWe should say nothing much about the presence of two or three U.S. carrier groups in the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean. Iran will soon grasp on its own that the build-up of such forces might presage air strikes that the United States excels in \u2014 and not more ground fighting that the American public apparently won't any longer stomach.\nWe must continue to make clear that Israel is a sovereign nation with a perfect right to protect itself. Sixty years after the Holocaust, no Israeli prime minister will sit still idly while seventh-century theocrats grandstand about wiping out Israel.\nLet's also keep our distance and moderate our rhetoric. There's no reason to frighten average Iranians \u2014 who may share our antipathy to their country's regime \u2014 or to make therapeutic pleas to talk with those leaders in bunkers whom we know are our enemies.\nFinally, and most importantly, Americans must conserve energy, gasify coal, diversify fuels, drill more petroleum and invent new energy sources. Only that can collapse the world price of petroleum.\nWhen oil is priced at $60 a barrel, Ahmadinejad is a charismatic Third World benefactor who throws cash to every thug who wants a roadside bomb or shouldered-fired missile \u2014 and has plenty of money to buy Pakistani, North Korean or Russian nuclear components. But when oil is $30 a barrel, Ahmadinejad will be despised by his own masses, who will become enraged as state-subsidized food and gas skyrocket, and scarce Iranian petrodollars are wasted on Hezbollah and Hamas.\nNone of these taps alone will fracture Iran and stop it from going nuclear. But all of them together might well crack Ahmadinejad's thin shell before he gets the bomb.",
        "A Vinasun taxi that fell into a sinkhole on Ho Chi Minh City's Le Van Sy Street on September 14, 2010. It took concerned agencies four hours to reach the site and begin getting the vehicle out.\nTran Thanh Binh lay screaming in pain, his legs crushed by an overturned truck.\nDozens of people nearby rushed to the accident spot on Ung Van Khiem Street in Ho Chi Minh City with crowbars, tree trunks and any other implement they could get their hands on to try and prise Binh out from beneath the truck.\nIt took about an hour to get him out, and by then Binh had fainted. The residents rushed him to the hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival.\nTraffic police officers and rescue vehicles arrived at the accident site only after Binh had been taken away.\nAs tragic as this March 22 incident was, the greater tragedy is that the late arrival of police and rescue forces in dire emergency situations is not an exception in HCMC.\nIn many cases of road accidents, mishaps or street fights, HCMC police and concerned rescue forces show up when it is too late, leaving residents with no choice but manage things on their own.\nAt around 4 p.m. on September 14, 2010, Nguyen Van Tinh, a driver for the Vinasun Taxi Company, was driving a taxi on Le Van Sy Street in District 3 when the taxi fell into a sinkhole.\nA sizeable section of the street suddenly collapsed under the weight of the 7-seater.\nTinh jumped out before his vehicle sank into the watery sludge. Terrified and helpless, Tinh called his relatives and friends for help. Nearby residents called authorities to no avail.\nIt was not until 8 p.m. that inspectors of traffic and public works showed up. One hour later, the cab was towed away.\nDuring the five or so hours that the cab was stuck in the hole, the narrow street experienced a severe traffic jam.\nCitizens have repeatedly noted that the response from concerned agencies is not just late, there is also no sense of urgency shown by the latter.\nMany residents say that when they telephone the police hotline 113 or a local police station's numbers, the reaction from officers on duty is lukewarm and uninterested.\nIn mid-February, a group of students living in a hired apartment in District 7's Le Van Luong Street called local police to report a robbery.\nNo one answered the phone the first time. On their second attempt, a police officer named Vuong Van Nho answered the phone.\nAfter Nho arrived at the apartment, he repeatedly yelled at the students, blaming their carelessness for the robbery.\nThe repeated indifference shown by police officers also deterred Nguyen Thi Tai, resident of an apartment building in District 3, from reporting littering acts by other residents living on higher floors.\n\"The more I complain, the more they litter,\"\u009d she said.\nOn the afternoon of October 11, 2011, four men pretended to be strangers waiting at an ATM booth in District 1, when 33-year-old Nguyen Thi Thanh Thuan entered it after parking and locking her motorbike on the sidewalk.\nTwo of the men then stood at the booth door to trap Thuan while two others unlocked the bike. They left with the bike even though the woman called 113 for help.\nThuan said police with the HCMC's rapid response force told her to file a report at the local police station as she helplessly watched the men drive her bike away.\nThe identity of the officer has not been released.\nHoang Thi Lien, a street vendor in HCMC, said she would never bother to report robberies to the police based on her own experiences.\nEarly this year, when Lien was pulling her CD handcart on a street in District 8, two men on a bicycle pretended to be buyers and grabbed the CDs.\nWhen Lien tried to chase them, two other men grabbed the remaining CDs on the handcart.\nLien cried for help but no passers-by on the crowded street stopped.\n\"It has happened to me before,\"\u009d she said. The first time, she reported the robbery to ward police, but received no response.\nSince then she does not bother to report anything, Lien said.\nA majority of residents do not know that 114 is the number they should call in case of fire or other emergencies, 113 for the rapid response police force and 115 for ambulance services.\nA 2010 study by the Trung Vuong Emergency Hospital found two thirds of HCMC residents do not know about the telephone number 115.\nDr. Huynh Thi Thanh Trang of the hospital's emergency department said more men seemed to know about 115 than women.\nMore people aged between 15 and 30, office workers, civil servants and students, know about the service than those in other groups, she said.\nThe survey also found that most people who do know about 115 learnt about it from newspapers, TV or the Internet.\nTrang said that even people who know about the service prefer to take their relatives to the hospital themselves.\nThe hospital explained that when people call 115 from the city, they are connected to the emergency department and an ambulance dispatched. If the call is from outside the city, the hospital calls the nearest district hospital to seek help.",
        "Charlie Miller Sr, had a dream to take the boys of Troop 203 to the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kan. As in most small Scout troops, funds had to be raised. Charlie started collecting scrap metal \u2013 aluminum cans \u2013 to sell. Over the last eight years he donated any funds he received to the troop, these fund were kept in an account for this event. After being brought to the committee for approval last fall the date was set, the reservations made and anticipation began.\nOn March 24, three leaders (one being Charlie) and 12 Scouts left Independence at 3 a.m. for this adventure. For those who are not sure what the Cosmosphere is, just ask any of the 12 boys who went and they have several memorable experiences to share.\nGabe Valdez, a fifth grader at Bryant Elementary, said the presentation and the hands on experience was great. His favorite part was building the robot, and getting the wheels to balance.\nCesar Gonzales, a sixth grader at Bingham, enjoyed learning about different spacecraft, and how they are used. His favorite part was building a rocket and launching it.\nAndrew Bennett, a freshman at William Chrisman High School, said the engineering aspect was great. He had to design something camping related, so he set out the task to design a unique hiking boot. Overall, he said, the entire trip was great for all levels of the group, including the leaders.\nScoutmaster Chuck Miller was impressed with the knowledge of the presenters and teachers at the Cosmosphere and felt everything the boys learned during the two-day camp was intense. His favorite part was the planetarium. He said watching the boys do all the different activities and coming home with three merit badges was an experience they soon won\u2019t forget.\nJody Bennett, assistant Scoutmaster, said all the presenters and teachers made the experience so everyone could understand. He was pleased the 12 boys were able to attend this experience.\nThe man who has waited for this experience Charlie Miller Sr, was more than pleased he said his favorite part of the trip was in the IMAX theatre. The film of the team repairing the Hubble space station was awesome and viewing earth from the space station is something he soon won\u2019t forget.\nTroop 203 is chartered by College Park Community of Christ Church. The troop has served the youth of College Park since 1950. More than 1,500 Scouts have learned the values of citizenship, character development, and personal fitness during the troop\u2019s 61-year history.",
        "US president renews call to reduce number of nuclear weapons held by Russia and US by one-third.\nUS President Barack Obama has renewed his call to reduce the world's nuclear stockpiles during a speech in front of Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate.\nObama pledged on Wednesday to reduce the number of nuclear weapons held by Russia and the US by one-third during a speech which used the theme \"peace through justice\".\n\"As president I will seek reductions in the US and Russia's tactical weapons while rejecting the nuclear weaponisation that North Korea and Iran may be seeking,\" he said.\nHe also called for a global reduction in the manufacturing of materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons.\nThe speech also included pledges over tackling climate change, which the president called \"the global threat of our time\" and unemployment.\nBut a senior Russian official said that the US deployment of anti-missile shields was a huge hurdle to any further cuts in the nuclear arsenals of the former Cold War foes.\n\"How can we take the idea of strategic nuclear weapons reductions seriously when the United States is building up its ability to intercept these ... weapons?\" Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said.\nThe Kremlin also said that the new cuts in nuclear stockpiles should expand beyond Russia and the US and include other nuclear armed states.\nEarlier in the day, President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the importance of Europe's relationship with the US.\n\"Sometimes there has been talk that the trans-atlantic alliance is fading in importance, that the United States has turned its attention more towards Asia and the Pacific,\" Obama said.\n\"In conversations with Chancellor Merkel and earlier with your president, I reminded them that from our perspective the relationship with Europe remains the cornerstone for our freedom and our security.\"\nMerkel was also keen to emphasise the impact the US had on Germany's own history.\n\"When the president addresses the crowd in front of the Brandenburg Gate, he will be a president who can do this in front of a gate that is open,\" she said.\n\"Other presidents had to remind us all that the wall needed to be torn down, and the wall is down and this is what we owe to our American partners and friends.\"\nObama spoke in front of Brandenburg Gate nearly 50 years after former US President John F Kennedy's famous Cold War speech in this once-divided city.\nThe US president made several references to the history of the gate, and the city, during his speech, which was warmly recieved by the cheering crowds.\n\"Today's threats are not as stark as they were half a century ago, but the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity, that struggle goes on,'' he said.\n\"I come here to this city of hope because the test of our time demands the same fighting spirit that defined Berlin a half-century ago.\n\"No wall can stand against the yearnings of justice, yearnings of freedom, yearnings of peace that stand in the human heart.\"\nObama acknowledged the need for more action on climate change, saying Germany and Europe had led the way, while the US still needed to do more.\nHe also addressed the recent national Security Agency scandal, saying that the spy programmes \"confront real dangers\", while acknowledging that the government needed to address concerns regarding privacy versus security.\n\"This is what makes us different to those on the other side of the wall,\" he said.",
        "Oskar Groening, the Auschwitz bookkeeper who was convicted at age 94 after a Munich court cleared the way for the prosecution of low-ranking officials accused of indirectly committing Nazi war crimes, has died. Groening was 96.\nHe died March 9, Der Spiegel magazine reported Monday. The publication wrote that prosecutors in Hanover, Germany, said Groening\u2019s lawyer had informed them of Groening\u2019s death. No cause was given.\nDubbed the \u201caccountant of Auschwitz,\u201d Groening went on trial in the northern German city of Lueneburg in April 2015, accused of complicity in the murder of at least 300,000 Jews at the concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II. His job was to collect money and valuables from prisoners\u2019 luggage and send them to Berlin.\nIn July 2015, he was sentenced to four years in prison. Initially deemed too ill for prison, he was declared fit for imprisonment in December and was scheduled to start serving his sentence soon.\nTrained as a banker, Groening told judges that he tried several times to be relocated to another post or to the front. The first time was when he saw an SS guard kill a baby by smashing it against a truck. The second was when he saw an SS soldier pour gas through a slot into a farmhouse where Jews were held. His third request to be relocated was finally accepted at the end of 1944 and he was moved to the front, he said.\nGroening\u2019s trial was part of a renewed effort to target low-ranking Third Reich perpetrators. It followed the 2011 conviction of former Sobibor extermination camp guard John Demjanjuk. Some lawyers said the case set aside the traditional requirement that prosecutors had to prove that workers in camps had committed individual criminal acts before they could be held personally responsible for atrocities.\nThe Munich judges in Demjanjuk\u2019s trial said it was enough to show he served at the Sobibor death camp, in Poland, to convict him. After that ruling, Germany\u2019s central Nazi crime investigation unit probed about 50 Auschwitz guards and asked prosecutors to charge 30.\nAuschwitz, the world\u2019s biggest cemetery for the number of deaths that occurred there from 1941 to 1945, included concentration, labor and extermination camps. As many as 1.5 million people were killed there during the Holocaust, according to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum.\nBorn on June 10, 1921, in Nienburg, Germany, Groening was the son of a fabric dealer who had lost an eye during World War I. His mother died when he was 4 years old, according to an article in Der Spiegel magazine.\nGroening said he came from a nationalist background and, like many Germans, he initially supported Adolf Hitler who \u201ccreated jobs for 5 million unemployed.\u201d He gave up his job at a local bank to join the Waffen-SS because their troops were \u201cdashing\u201d and he wanted to participate in their triumphs, he said at his trial. He didn\u2019t know what some SS units did in concentration camps, he added, or what Auschwitz was before he got there in 1942.\nAfter the war, Groening spent three years in a British prison. Released in 1948, he worked as a payroll clerk at a glass-making factory in Lueneburg Heath in Lower Saxony until his retirement, according to a BBC article.\nIn the 1970s, state prosecutors in Frankfurt investigated him over his role in managing the property of prisoners during the war. Proceedings against him were dropped the following decade.",
        "Staff photo by Cathy CramerEight municipalities are discussing joining a joint municipal court system to be hosted by Upper Deerfield Township.\nIn a cost-saving response to the mounting pressures of reduced revenue and a push toward shared services by the state, eight local municipalities are discussing unification in a joint municipal court system.\nShiloh Borough and Deerfield, Greenwich, Hopewell, Lawrence, Stow Creek, Pittsgrove and Upper Deerfield townships are in the process of establishing the logistics of a joint court system to potentially begin processing a shared caseload in January 2012.\nMunicipality officials have been meeting for months to work out the logistics of a shared system to be hosted in Upper Deerfield Township. A committee with equal representation and voting power from each municipality is expected to make decisions on such issues as personnel, facilities and other management determinations.\nAccording to a draft budget and analysis for the joint court system, the eight municipalities lost an approximated total of $242,490 in 2010 due to court expenses far exceeding revenue.\nThe 2012 joint court loss for all eight municipalities combined is tentatively projected to be $60,799 \u2014 a potential loss reduction of more than $181,000.\n\u201cEvery municipality lost money in their courts last year. Hopefully with this new structure, that\u2019ll be decreased greatly,\u201d Daddario said.\nDaddario said the municipalities are hoping to add more sessions than currently held and reduce case processing time along the way.\n\u201cIt will all be located in one court so a judge is not running from court to court to hear cases, and all the record-keeping, everything, is in one location,\u201d he said.\nDeerfield Township Mayor John Stanzione said Wednesday that, while the joint court system seems to be a good way to save money, he remained concerned about the potential for jobs to be lost in a poor economic climate.\nHowever, Daddario pointed out that Hopewell\u2019s currently shared court system with Greenwich, Stow Creek and Shiloh houses only one employee, and it is not yet known if or how many jobs would be lost as part of the consolidation.\nFurthermore, Deerfield Township Committeeman Keith Lauermann pointed out that the municipalities would likely best serve their constituents\u2019 interests and retain individuality by setting up a shared system on their terms sooner rather than later.\nOrdinances formally establishing participation in the joint municipal court will be drafted and reviewed in coming weeks.",
        "The lack of a kitchen in an Indian Lake homeowner's garage paved the way to an unprecedented ruling regarding land use rights in the borough.\nThe Somerset County Court of Common Pleas ruled July 5 that David Rohrich's 1,085 square foot car garage was not considered a residence because it \"lacks the signature component of every true residence: a kitchen.\"\nRohrich was cited by the borough's zoning hearing board for violating an ordinance that restricts each lot to one residence or dwelling. The hearing board argued that Rohrich's property violated the terms of its building permit \u2014 which prohibited \"living quarters\" \u2014 because the second floor of his garage contained plumbing, a shower and rooms that could be used to sleep in.\nJudge D. Gregory Geary wrote in an 18-page ruling that the garage cannot be considered a second dwelling without a kitchen.\n\"When one views the second story improvements objectively, all that is there is a place to sleep and shower, albeit rather comfortably,\" he wrote. \"Those accommodations are well-suited for a transient or temporary stay to be sure, but they simply do not amount to what one would commonly consider as a residence.\"\nRohrich said the borough was on a \"witch hunt.\" He argued that his garage was the first ever to be subject to inspection. The issue has been ongoing since 2006.\n\"Our plans were always laid out with what we were going to do with the garage,\" he said when reached at home Wednesday night. \"It was never going to be a guesthouse, but they (borough council) made the assumption.\"\nBorough Mayor Mike Miscoe said the ruling opens the door for other residents looking to convert their garage into a guesthouse.\nThe borough's zoning ordinance restricts duel residences on properties because of regulations on sewage.\nResidences obtain sewage permits based on the number of bedrooms in the home. The rationale is that bedrooms equate to the number of occupants utilizing the restroom.\n\"What if everyone does this?\" Miscoe asked. \"It overburdens the sewage system.\"\nCouncil President Patricia Dewar said the precedent is unfair to borough residents.\n\"It's unfair to those who spent the time and money (to comply),\" she said.\nThe borough voted 4-2 against appealing the ruling. Councilmen Lynn Shimer and Terry St. Clair voted to pursue the appeal.\nCouncilman Robert Marhefka said he voted against appealing to save borough tax dollars. Borough Solicitor Dan Rullo estimated the cost to appeal to be between $5,000 and $10,000.\n\"We talk about cutting costs and trying to scour the budget for savings,\" Marhefka said, \"and then we throw it away on legal costs.\"\nRohrich said he spent more than $10,000 on legal costs in his defense. He said he offered to settle the dispute financially with the borough outside of court, but an agreement could not be reached.\n\"The real shame in all of this is that borough residents are paying for this,\" he said.\nBorough Council plans to revisit its zoning ordinance pertaining to the matter in the coming months.",
        "NORTHAMPTON -- A year after Wired West clashed with state officials over its plan to build, own, and operate a broadband network in dozens of rural communities, the group has resurfaced with \"Plan B\" and a new sense of hope that the Massachusetts Broadband Institute, or MBI, will work with them.\nOn Saturday, the cooperative hosted a well-attended meeting at JFK Middle School in Northampton where they unveiled their new concept. The room was filled with local officials from across the region, most of whom have grown frustrated with the slow pace of rural broadband deployment in the state.\nWired West is still pushing for a fiber-to-the-home network spanning up to 27 towns. Its leaders are still touting fiber as a blazing-fast, future-proof technology, and say the regional concept would be more economical than one where each town goes it alone.\nBut now, following a shift in state policy, they propose to merely operate the network instead of trying to do everything themselves, including actually stringing cable on utility poles.\nUnder the new plan, member towns would manage the build of their own \"last mile\" fiber optic networks, using state and local funding. They could optionally get help with engineering and design from MBI.\nThe town networks would then be joined in a ring topology and connected to MassBroadband123, the state-owned \"middle mile\" backbone privately operated by Axia Networks.\nWired West would hire an experienced contractor -- such as Westfield Gas & Electric or OTT Communications out of Maine -- to serve as Internet Service Provider and maintain the cables and electronics. The contractor would provide \"wholesale services white-labeled as Wired West,\" said Jim Drawe, chairman of the cooperative's executive committee.\nPeter Larkin said Massachusetts Broadband Institute will work with every town individually to determine the best way to extend broadband internet to each community.\nWiredWest would take care of billing, contracting, insurance, and other oversight tasks, while outsourcing accounting and legal services, said Drawe.\nUnder the plan, the towns would bond for around 70 percent of their buildout cost, and 30 percent would be covered by a construction grant from MBI. Operations -- including the towns' debt service and required depreciation reserves -- would be covered by subscriber fees.\nDrawe said the fees would have to be competitive with Verizon in order to attract a high enough \"take rate\" to make the network sustainable. He said he's confident any network would start with at least 40 percent of all households on board.\nHe said at a 40 percent take rate, Wired West should be able to offer 25-megabit internet at $59 per month; one-gigabit speeds at $75 a month, and digital telephone services at $19 a month.\nDozens of towns in western Massachusetts still do not have residential high-speed internet service. The state Legislature in 2014 authorized $50 million to complete the so-called \"last mile.\" The earlier middle mile extended fiber to public institutions in rural communities using $40 million in state money, appropriated in 2008, and $45 million in federal stimulus funds.\nWhile some progress has been made in connecting homes and businesses with broadband, many unserved towns still remain at the starting gate. While some critics have blamed administrative delays, another reason is financial. Even with state broadband grants, towns will have to borrow money to get started.\nWired West insists that its vision for a cooperatively-run regional network -- where the larger and more populous towns would subsidize some of the smaller and poorer towns -- offers the best solution for the region's economic development as well as the best bargain for all.\nWired West leaders said the annual cost of any one town receiving \"backhaul\" services from the middle mile would be $28,000. By joining forces, fewer connections would be necessary, resulting in savings across the board.\nBut in order to work, a critical mass of towns would have to to get on board. Wired West says that 14 communities have already expressed support for their model, seven \"are seriously considering\" it, and that 16 \"are actively pursuing other options, but have not ruled out\" joining the proposed regional fiber network.\nWired West's new, scaled-down plan seems to have incorporated suggestions made in late 2015 by a consulting firm hired by the state to review the cooperative's original business plan.\nAt the time, WiPro Technologies principal Michael Morgenstern was intensely critical of Wired West's plan, which involved hiring a sizable staff, buying bucket trucks, leasing real estate, establishing a call center, building a server operation, and more. His report charged that the plan understated costs and was unsustainable.\nAmong other things, Morgenstern suggested that Wired West keep it simple and outsource major tasks to experienced contractors.\nWired West subsequently lashed out at MBI as the state put the brakes on its relationship with the cooperative. Soon thereafter, Governor Charlie Baker \"hit the pause button,\" rebooted the rural broadband program, hired new people, and invited towns to work individually with the state.\nBaker's invitation did not preclude a regional solution, and cooler heads prevailed at Saturday's meeting in Northampton.\nNow, in addition to outsourcing engineering and major network operations, Wired West says it will not hire staff, and will continue to operate as a volunteer organization. The only overhead costs would be accounting and legal services, said Drawe.\nVice treasurer Jeremy Dunn told the audience that all Wired West financials and business proposals would be posted on the group's website, and invited outside scrutiny. Town officials were sent home with thumb drives containing reams of data and other information.\n\"We want you to take a careful look,\" he said. \"We hereby invite you to poke holes in it. Give us feedback. We want to be as transparent as possible.\"\nWired West began nearly a decade ago as a handful of volunteers who envisioned bringing broadband service to the state's far-flung hilltowns. For years, they drummed up support for the idea, worked productively with the state, and persuaded 7,000 households to submit a $49 deposit, now sitting in escrow, to show their support for a regional fiber network.\nIn 2011, Wired West legally incorporated as a cooperative of Municipal Light Plants, which are town-owned utilities authorized under state law. Each town that wants to be a Wired West member must form a so-called MLP. Each MLP sends a delegate to Wired West to serve on the governing body.\nIn the months since Baker rebooted the program, a handful of communities have moved forward with individual solutions. And nine towns with partial cable will see an extension of that technology since Comcast won $5 million in state grants.\nAt this point, Wired West is not the only game in town.\nSix private companies have indicated an interest in providing turnkey services. The firms responded to a Nov. 18 solicitation by MBI, which will allocate nearly $20 million in grants.\nOf the proposals, Fiber Connect said it could network eight communities in the Berkshires. Crocker Communications proposed regional fiber spanning 40 towns. Westfield Gas & Electric indicated it would work with any town to build and operate fiber. Comcast and Charter Communications proposed a short list of towns it could serve with cable. Mid Hudson seeks $260,000 for a wireless network in Tyringham.\nMBI has not yet said whether the private proposals will be acceptable to the state. The broadband institute emphasized that each individual town will ultimately have the power to make its own decision.\nFor its part, Wired West maintains that the for-profit companies would not provide the best value for the towns. Its leaders on Saturday invited local officials to make that determination for themselves.\n\"Go home, and research this carefully with your broadband committees, finance committees, and select boards,\" said Gayle Huntress, a member of the Shutesbury Broadband Committee. \"Assess your risks, and assess your benefits.\"\nHuntress said Wired West would like to see a commitment from the towns, one way or the other, over the next several months. She said any regional broadband build would still take two or three years to complete.\nPresent at Saturday's meeting was Sen. Adam Hinds, D-Pittsfield, elected in November to represent the sprawling Berkshire, Hampshire, Franklin and Hampden district on Beacon Hill. Hinds, sitting at the back of the room, said he was there to listen and learn.\n\"Nothing is more critical to my district,\" he said of the rural broadband initiative. \"It's time to get this over the finish line.\" Asked if he is inclined to support Wired West, Hinds said he is \"inclined to doing what it takes to finish the process.\"\nLeaders with MBI plan a February 16 meeting with local officials to discuss the rural broadband issue. The time and location has not yet been set.\nWired West has asked the state to take several steps, including clarifying that each town does not need its own, individual connection to the middle mile.",
        "Typing Assistant provides the ability to autocomplete words and save time. With a minimum of frills and an impressively large dictionary, this program will shave minutes off writing.\nThis program's interface reminded us of the word-completing software present in text messaging, but still required a visit to the Help file's simple instructions for the basics. While its functionality proved to be initially distracting, we quickly grew to anticipate it. Once we wrote a few letters (for example, \"Arr\") a small screen popped up, providing a list of possible solutions (this example ranged from Arrack, Arrange, Array, and more). We either kept typing our word or scrolled through the choices and chose the correct one. Happily, the word we needed was usually toward the top and required less than a second to pick. The time saved using this program depended heavily on its best feature, an adjustable delay. When we wanted instant help we set no delay, but when we only wanted help if we were stuck on a spelling, we set the program to a longer delay before the screen appeared. No matter how we set it, this was a fantastic option for avoiding the word processor's spelling helper and has the ability to shave minutes from projects.\nTyping Assistant comes with a 21-day trial. This program installs desktop icons without asking permission and leaves Start menu items and folders behind after uninstall.\nTyping Assistant auto-completes your frequently used words and phrases anywhere. It makes typing faster, more intelligent and lowers effort. When typing, a smart Typing Assistant suggestion window opens to show you possible words you are typing. Then with one key stroke it automatically completes the word for you. Typing Assistant automatically learns the words you type, automatically expands user-defined shorthand to full text, automatically accesses clipboard history contents, and automatically launches user-defined application. So that the more you use the program, the smarter it becomes and the more you find it useful. Typing Assistant is the ideal utility for authors, secretaries, journalists, translators, document creators and programmers, in fact anyone who frequently uses a word processor.\n\"One of my most important programs\"\nEase of use. Good dictionaries. Good customer support.\nThis program is one of the most important ones installed on my computer. I am dyslexic, so without an aid, my spelling is horrible. Typing Assistant fixes it for me which saves embarrassment. Also I am a slow typist , so this program speeds up my typing because I type fewer characters. With the text expander, I can type whole paragraphs by entering a few letters. Highly recommendable.\n\"Instrumental program! I can't live without it\"\nLarge dictionaries. Lightweight. Time saving. Unobtrusive.\nFor me, as a translator, TypingAssistant is a life saver. I spend all day at the keyboard and every extra keystroke is felt at the end of the day. So I can delegate some of the typing to TypingAssistant and let it complete words and catch typos.\nCustomer support is excellent. They always respond same day.\nThe functions Auto-Learn, Auto-Correct, and Auto-clipboard are extremely useful. It allows me to avoid some embarrassed errors that I have made from time to time before. On the top of all that, Using the hotkey Ctl+Win remembers what I said in the previous text. Like a CAT, it allows for inconsisteny of wording.\nMore operating instructions will get better.\nStrongly recommended for freelance translators!\nThe program keeps crashing, and pop ups happen every now and again then you have to re enter the Licence details in the program very annoying.\nIt worked well when I used it except for the errors.\nErrors opening or saving files.\nI installed the Desktop version first, but I got error messages that say \"Open file error\". I checked the Help in the program and says to then use the Portable version. I disabled the Windows protection called User Account Control since I thought the errors had to do with access rights to the C drive. I uninstalled the Desktop version and installed the Portable version, but I still got the same errors and the program crashes.\n\"This is a great product and well worth buying!\"\nThis is great product and will save you a lot of time. You can selectively add words and phrases to the softwares text prediction library. Moreover this software is unobtrusive and is simple and easy to use. A real winner - buy it!\nThe only improvement I can see that is necessary is a way to have a one-click or automated removal of spelling errors picked up by the Auto-Learn feature.\nI like tje product because It makes me a faster and more efficient types and save me having to type repetitive tricky words ovre and over again! It also allows insertion of customised phrases and all phrases and words can be inserted with the simple press of the number keys.\nThis is a great product and is well worth buying. I highly recommend it!\n\"Fantastic for filling forms. Works like a charm.\"\nHas a shortcuts feature - fantastic for filling long details.\nIt auto learns wrong spellings - you'll have to remove them manually.\nNeat program with all the pros listed above. Great help in filling out long forms by using a shortcut. For instance I can write my address and give it any shortcut, say \"adr\". As I type adr it prompts me for my full address which I select by hitting a pre-determined key (such as ctrl or space) and my full address gets typed out.\nIt prompts long words when I type the initial letters, words come from its dictionary plus the words it auto-learns from my usage.\n\"TREMENDOUS timesaver for BOTH fast AND slow typists.\"\nAfter giving TypingAssistant a chance to 'learn you', the required word is almost always the first or second entry in the pop-up menu.\nWords you use often can regularly be typed in 3 strokes WITHOUT HAVING TO ENTER THEM MANUALLY.\nSpelling mistakes get recorded and remembered. Not a serious problem--I periodically delete them from the list.\nGreat program IF YOU GIVE IT A CHANCE TO LEARN YOUR typing habits---Please note that its full functioning will not be apparent at first! After using it for a while, the required word is almost always the first or second entry in the pop-up menu, thus enabling even fast typists to type even faster. Also, knowing that words I use a lot will appear as entry 1, I now automatically type the first 2 letters and 1. Like for my email address, I automatically type em1. This is better than Auto-complete, as I often would want to write a word beginning with 'em' (ie NOT my email address), so you don't want it completing automatically. Another great plus which I use regularly is multiple clipboard entries.\n\"Remember and prompt everything you want to type .\"\nIt's very smart and convenient. I've tested several typing-help programmers, it's the best. Especially useful for those who have to type repeated things.\nIt will be better if there are more help file and demos. Before the author improving it, I think it deserved to spend some time to learn and use if you have those repeated things.\nVery useful for repeated type things.\n\"This is just the program I have been wanting for years.\"\nAuto learn long words or phrases, such as people's name or address. Just a single hot key to browse all abbreviation entries and select one to expand to full text. It is very well integrated with other edit windows.\nIt is better than the others.\nThe self learning function makes typing faster and accurate. The suggestions list always there when you type anywhere. Really a very well designed tool.\nVersion 8.3: Fixed the problem in Thunderbird when typing letters with circumflex.",
        "This week we are going to enjoy some ancient Indian ruins and petroglyphs. Remember, you can visit both the Brooklyn Mine and today\u2019s places in a single trip, so for driving directions contact me through the Courier\u2019s senior editor, Tim Wiederaenders (use Subject: Brooklyn Rim).\nOriginally Published: October 13, 2018 8:49 p.m.\nBefore I describe today\u2019s visit, here is an update on the Brooklyn Mine I described last article. I asked readers to give me more info on this mine because my research hadn\u2019t found much. Three readers were very helpful. Cal Cordes, whose recent ancestors ran the sheep station at Cordes, told me about his visit to the mine in 1936 when he was 10. Mike Spencer and Tom Blake really know their way around the Web and have shared all sorts of info about the mine. I\u2019ll give you updates later. In future, any reader who has info to share on an Amazing Place, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.\nThere are scores of Indian ruins and hundreds of petroglyphs in the area of the Agua Fria National Monument (AFNM). It\u2019s worth repeating that the heyday for these Indians was the period between 1250 and 1450 AD (CE) \u2013 why they left isn\u2019t fully understood but probably an extended drought. Because the AFNM area is isolated, some of the ruins have been looted, and some of the petroglyphs have even been cut from the cliffs where they were carved centuries ago. People who do this are criminals and have no respect for history \u2013 shame on them! Fortunately, there are many ruins and petroglyphs that can be visited and enjoyed.\nWe\u2019ll begin by going to some pueblo ruins. The first photo shows a room inside one of the pueblos. The roof is long gone but this wall is still intact, neatly constructed from the local rocks \u2013 some colored sandstone, some black basalt (volcanic rock). Originally the wall was probably higher; the floor of the room has filled up a little with dirt blown in over the centuries, and the top of the wall may have crumbled. Along the Brooklyn Rim there are four small pueblos in a line, about \u00bd mile between ruin 1 and ruin 4 \u2013 the aerial map in the driving directions shows each pueblo was different in size (ruin 3 is the largest and best). Perhaps each pueblo housed various generations of a different family. This line of pueblos runs pretty much from north to south along the flat mesa, about 50 feet west of the rim. The rim is a volcanic cliff, whose height varies from 10 to 30 feet, sheer in most places. Below the base of the cliff, the ground slopes down into the basin, 150 feet below, where there is a small creek (and also the Mine). If you explore inside the ruins of these pueblos, don\u2019t climb on the fragile walls. If you see any pottery sherds, don\u2019t touch them or take them \u2013 leave them in place for future archaeologists.\nThe second photo shows one of the many petroglyph panels that extend for about \u00bc mile below the rim. Reaching these petroglyphs could be a challenge unless you are fit and don\u2019t mind scrambling down a gap in the cliff. Once you get to the foot of the cliff, there\u2019s a rough path that other explorers have made for viewing the petroglyphs. In the photo, you can see various animals that were native to the area: deer, pronghorn, maybe bighorn sheep & elk, and probably a turtle at top left. Other panels show various symbols (a cross, crescent moon, spirals) as well as humans.\nNigel Reynolds was born in England and has lived in Arizona for 40 years, and in Prescott for over 20 years. \u201cExploring is in my blood,\u201d he says.

        "For 40 years, OOIDA's Board of Directors has convened twice a year at the organization's headquarters in Grain Valley, MO, to conduct business and frame the agenda for the coming year. Board members also discuss the concerns voiced by the membership and decide which of those the Association will take to a target-issue level.\nDuring the spring meeting in April, board members heard reports, set strategies, re-elected two officers, seated five newly elected alternate directors and approved a longtime employee to a high-level executive position. It also accepted a surprise \u2013 and sizable \u2013 scholarship donation from a mystery guest from the past.\nOOIDA\u2019s proposed safety agenda grabbed a top spot, specifically driver training, safe truck parking availability and cab crashworthiness.\nA special guest from the Federal Highway Administration in Washington, DC, agreed that the Association\u2019s input is vital to developing solutions to issues that are critical elements to safety \u2013 specifically truck parking.\n\u201cI am appreciative of the time that the executive board afforded FHWA to discuss the truck parking activities that have been undertaken and to discuss those that are planned,\u201d FHWA\u2019s Tom Kearney said after the meeting.\nKearney is the freight operations program director for FHWA. He spent a day at OOIDA headquarters during the meeting and spoke at length to the board. Kearney is the manager of the administration\u2019s truck parking program and has been charged with the congressionally mandated Jason\u2019s Law survey.\nSpencer \u2013 with the DC staff\u2019s Ben Siegrist and Ryan Bowley \u2013 reported to the board on key legislation that is on OOIDA\u2019s radar and provided an update on issues \u2013 speed limiters, truck size and weight, sleep apnea, HOS, Mexican trucks \u2013 that are high on the Association\u2019s priority list.\nPresident Johnston advised the board on the Association\u2019s litigation activities, including several old cases and a few new ones. Johnston reported appeals in both OOIDA v. C.R. England and OOIDA v. Comerica Bank. OOIDA and named plaintiffs have filed suit against Pacific Financial Registry. Watch for details on that lawsuit in the July issue.\nThe Association has a number of regulatory-related lawsuits pending against FMCSA.\nThe most recent suit was filed in December 2012. The Association contends the agency is setting \u201cde facto\u201d regulation on fatigued driving using performance-based standards \u2013 something the agency has said it cannot regulate in the past.\nAnother lawsuit filed last year pertains to the agency\u2019s DataQ challenge. DataQs are the process in which motor carriers can theoretically correct bad inspection data used in the Pre-Employment Screening program. That data is the same data that is used by Compliance, Safety, Accountability or CSA.\nIn both the fatigue enforcement and DataQ lawsuits the agency has filed motions to dismiss and the Association has opposed both motions.\nThe Association intervened in the hours-of-service lawsuit currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the DC Circuit. The case was argued in March and a decision is pending. In the meantime, the regulations will go into effect July 1.\nOOIDA is also financially backing and providing legal assistance to OOIDA Member Gene Michaud\u2019s constitutional challenge of speed limiters in Ontario, Canada, Johnston reported. The Ontario Court dismissed the charges against Michaud. The court ruled that the Ontario law violated Michaud\u2019s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically the right to security of the person. That ruling has been appealed, and the appeal will be heard later this year.\nJohnston also reported to the board that OOIDA\u2019s Washington, DC, counsel is preparing to file two more lawsuits that will be announced soon.\nThe Association\u2019s regulatory affairs are currently managed by Spencer, Rod Nofziger, a special committee of regulatory experts from the Business Assistance Department, and Land Line Managing Editor Jami Jones. They tag-teamed to give the board additional regulatory updates.\nJones reported that the final rule on a drug and alcohol clearinghouse is now at the Office of Management and Budget for review. The Medical Examiners Registry created by a final rule issued a year ago will be mandatory in the summer of 2013. The proposed rule will automatically link medical certifications to state licensing agencies.\nJones also reported that in the fall of 2013 MAP-21\u2019s broker reform requirements will begin going into effect.\nShe also gave status updates for the requirement of electronic stability control systems on heavy trucks in the next four years. NHTSA\u2019s final rule is expected to be published in the spring of next year and will cover new vehicles only.\nJones updated the board on Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA), currently being audited by the Government Accountability Office and the DOT Inspector General. She said the focus of the audit is on methodology and any \u201ctie\u201d to safety. She said Congress is still very much focused on CSA \u2013 mostly in the U.S. House \u2013 and that there\u2019s likely to be a hearing before the end of the year.",
        "Geography as a subject is in decline and needs to be made more relevant with a greater focus on global issues, England's schools inspectors have said.\nClimate change, sustainable development and trade disputes could all be studied to increase interest, Ofsted said.\nIts report, based on inspections and surveys between 2004 and 2007, said geography was the worst-taught subject and that pupils saw it as \"boring.\"\nThe government said teaching of the subject was being revitalised.\nThe report concluded that growing numbers of pupils were opting to drop the subject after the age of 14, when it is no longer compulsory.\nIt was especially critical of geography teaching at Key Stage 3 (age 11 to 14), saying lessons at this level were too often taken by non-specialists because schools focused more on the GCSE years.\nInspectors have called for a shake-up with more fieldwork plus lessons on climate change, trade and the concepts of sustainable living and environmental footprints.\nChief inspector of education Christine Gilbert said: \"Geography is at a crucial period in its development.\n\"More needs to be done to make the subject relevant and more engaging for pupils.\"\nThe report was based on inspections from 2004 and 2005 and from specific surveys of geography in schools between 2004 and 2007.\n\"Recent annual subject reports by Ofsted have highlighted weaknesses in geography in primary and secondary schools and have provided some evidence of decline in the overall quality of provision,\" the report said.\nMost primary and secondary schools surveyed did not recognise the value of fieldwork and \"did not fulfil the requirement to provide it\".\nSchools were concerned about health and safety, time, expertise and budgets, inspectors found.\nThe report said: \"It is important that the citizens of tomorrow understand the management of risk, appreciate diversity, are aware of environmental issues, promote sustainability and respect human rights and social inclusion.\n\"If the aspiration of schools is to create pupils who are active and well-rounded citizens, there is no more relevant subject than geography.\"\nSchools Minister Jim Knight said: \"Last year we made radical reforms to the geography curriculum to make it more engaging and more relevant to young people's lives - bringing in topics like environmental change and sustainable development, but keeping the essential basics of maps and globes and atlases.\n\"An innovative new GCSE is being piloted that captures the relevance and excitement of contemporary geography.\n\"Geography is an important subject which helps young people analyse, explore and question the world in which we live. We know we need to enthuse young people about geography.\"\nThe director of the Royal Geographical Society, Dr Rita Gardner, said many of Ofsted's concerns were already being addressed.\n\"Fundamentally, the provision of good geography teaching lies with the teachers themselves,\" she said.\n\"Whilst there are many examples of good geography teaching, we need non-specialist and the less-motivated specialist teachers to be encouraged to raise their game.\n\"We will do all that we can to support teachers in achieving that.\"\nLiberal Democrat children, schools and families spokesman, David Laws, said a lack of specialist teachers and a failure to recognise the value of fieldwork was turning pupils away from the subject.\n\"Geography can be a practical and varied subject, but this report suggests it is at risk of becoming too dry,\" he said.\n\"Overly bureaucratic health and safety concerns should not be allowed to prevent schools from involving pupils in engaging and interesting fieldwork projects.\"",
        "And we\u2019re not talking about a pale imitation, either. This is the same sandwich \u2014 with thin-sliced ribeye steak and sweet green bell peppers \u2014 that was sold at the fairgrounds for years by Angelo DiPietro. Fairgoers\u2019 love of the pepper steak \u2014 equal in popularity only to the strawberry shortcake, which returned last year \u2014 prompted lines out of the door of the building where the steaks were sold.\nDiPietro died in 2006, but his sons, Fred and Mike DiPietro were going through their dad\u2019s things this year when they happened upon the old recipes and thought it might be fun to bring back the original sandwich. By coincidence, Fair Manager Valerie Merklin had been thinking the same thing and called to find out if they\u2019d be interested.\nWell. not quite everything. The DiPietro brothers started working at the Pepper Steak House when they were just kids. They worked the register, moved up to slicing meat and peppers and did anything else that was needed during 15-hour days. That was back when the fair was a 10-day extravaganza. And since then, the fare at the fair has gone beyond corn dogs and funnel cake, adding a variety of foods and events to appeal to a more diverse audience.\nAngelo\u2019s Pepper Steak will be sold at the Expo Hall Food Circle during the Aug. 2-5 run.

        "Instead America should bring the troops home.\nAs the anniversary of the September 11 attacks draws near, the Afghanistan War\u2014the nearly seventeen-year-old conflict those terrible events spawned\u2014is seeing a change in leadership. Army Lt. Gen. Austin Scott Miller, America\u2019s ninth commander, is preparing to take charge of the effort but has already admitted to his lack of innovative thinking. At his confirmation hearing in June, he told the Senate that he couldn\u2019t guarantee a timeline for bringing U.S. troops home. This is unfortunate\u2014and expected. Despite the change of command, Miller represents the same stale thinking that has permeated U.S. foreign policy for the last two decades.\nLast Wednesday, outgoing Afghanistan commander Gen. John Nicholson, held his final press conference, where he repeated the same talking points on making progress with nothing to show for it. This comes on the heels of a very violent past few weeks in Afghanistan featuring multiple suicide bomb attacks that killed dozens. If there were true progress, America would be creating an exit plan instead of supporting indefinite sustained commitment.\nBut the Pentagon continues to argue that the Afghanistan mission is about protecting the homeland, asserting that Al Qaeda\u2019s unmolested presence there in the 1990s allowed them to carry out the attacks on 9/11. In reality, those terrible attacks were coordinated from multiple points across the globe\u2014including inside the United States. Moreover, the intelligence community missed almost two dozen opportunities to stop them. Additionally, there are now multiple Al Qaeda-inspired groups across the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.\nBut the deadliest threat to America since 9/11 comes from domestic terrorists. In the grand scheme of things, terrorism is a small threat, and American military presence in Afghanistan is not necessary to mitigate it.\nU.S. policy in Afghanistan is to build and train a competent Afghan security force that can stand on its own two feet. Seventeen years of investment has not produced that. Fed by corruption and bureaucratic incompetence that results in poor support for troops, desertion rates were 30 percent annually until 2016, when those figures became classified. Another sign of the Afghan army\u2019s failure is the amount of territory contested or controlled by the Taliban, which has consistently risen since the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) began tracking it.\nYet open-ended American involvement is still defended. For instance, Max Boot, a columnist for the Washington Post and proponent of the American presence in Afghanistan, doesn\u2019t even bother with the idea of training Afghan fighters. Instead, he argues that the United States should keep 14,000 troops in Afghanistan indefinitely, calling it \u201cthe least bad option.\u201d As his guide, Boot uses the British, who competed with Russia for control of Central Asia in the nineteenth century. But his own source says the British were unable and unwilling to hold Afghanistan because it was too big a burden. Therefore, the \u201cleast bad option\u201d is to leave Afghanistan\u2019s security problems to the Afghan people, especially considering America\u2019s involvement is making a long-term solution less likely.\nIn spite of best intentions, a permanent U.S. presence would not only exacerbate conflict\u2014 but it would also further traumatize the Afghan people. The Afghan people have endured immense trauma over four decades of unbroken war, with U.S. involvement in nearly the entirety of the last two. Afghans, who are often tormented by mental health issues stemming from conflict, need counselors, not troops\u2014who suffer from PTSD, too.\nDespite all the evidence that this war is a waste and harmful to those America is trying to help, the Pentagon and the foreign policy establishment consistently stress that things are actually looking up. Frankly, there is no incentive to admit that things may be going poorly. Unless the president is willing to bear the political costs of failure\u2013\u2013and thus far Trump has proven he is not\u2013\u2013the answer will always be that more time, troops, and funding is necessary.\nThe United States can't build a self-sustaining Afghanistan. America can't wait for a goldilocks scenario in order to leave, because no such thing exists. Afghanistan serves no strategic purpose, and the U.S. military can defend the American homeland without continued intervention. As Gen. Miller assumes the helm of U.S. forces, he should do something genuinely game-changing and recommend bringing them home.\nSophia Larson is a freelance writer and Young Voices contributor.

        "The University of Maryland President Wallace Loh.\nUniversity of Maryland President Wallace Loh stood before reporters Aug. 14 and apologized to the family of Jordan McNair, a football player who died days after a team workout. That day, Loh also announced a commission charged with examining the culture inside the school's embattled football program, an undertaking that could prompt sweeping changes at the state's flagship university.\nIn June, the school had contracted with an outside consulting firm to investigate the events surrounding McNair's death. But the commission Loh announced nearly two months later would be charged with a broader inquiry into the culture of the school's football program - a \"thorough investigation by an independent group,\" Loh said - following media reports that suggested some coaches were abusive toward players, relying on fear, intimidation and bullying.\nFew details about the group's work to date are publicly available, but the commission's directives and composition reveal some of the inherent obstacles that arise when independent bodies investigate problems in university athletic departments.\nIn an initial email to the newly-appointed commission members, a copy of which was viewed by The Washington Post, Loh advised that some of the allegations they would be investigating \"probably occur in every football program\" and that the line between aggressive and abusive training techniques is \"imprecise.\"\nAlso, several of the commission members have previous ties with the university and the stakeholders in the affair. One served as a personal advisor to Loh. Another is the brother of an influential booster.\nAlmost immediately after the commission's unveiling, the University System of Maryland's board of regents took control from the College Park campus, adding five additional members to the three named by Loh and suggesting that key decisions about the football program's future would be made by the regents, not necessarily the school president. The vice chair of the board of regents is a prominent donor to the athletics department and has voiced public support for head football coach DJ Durkin.\nThis investigation could go a long way to determining the fate of Durkin, who was placed on administrative leave along with three other member of the athletic staff in the immediate aftermath of the media reports. One of those, football strength and conditioning coach Rick Court, has negotiated a settlement and resigned.\nAccording to multiple people familiar with the process, Durkin was interviewed by investigators on the morning of Aug. 22, and they were particularly keen on questioning Durkin about his alleged use of food to demean players, possible verbal abuse and his handling of injuries.\nThe commission's review is expected to also look at the actions of other prominent coaches and staff members, including Damon Evans, who was promoted to athletics director less than two weeks after McNair's death. Loh, too, could find himself scrutinized by one or both of the external probes. He nixed a plan recommended by the school's athletic director to fundamentally change the way athletes receive medical treatment and athletic training less than a year before McNair died.\nThere is no formal deadline for the commission to complete its review of the football program.\n\"We're trying to get that all done this month, one way or another, so that all the facts we can gather are in front of the board and the campus and then decisions can be made about the future,\" Robert Caret, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, said in an interview last week, \"both to protect student-athletes themselves but also to create the kind of environment we want.\"\nA day after he addressed reporters, Loh sent an email to his three new commission members, as well as a handful of school officials, laying out the assignment. He told them \"to interview a sufficiently large sample of current and former players, their parents, athletics staff , and any other relevant stakeholders, in order to make an assessment on whether the relatively few (but deeply troubling) cases of alleged 'abuse,' reported anonymously in the media, indicate the existence of a widespread 'toxic culture' . . . or, do these reported cases represent only a small portion of the population of football players, present and past.\"\nLoh told the members that \"arguably, a hyper-masculine and insular culture is the norm, rather than the exception, in college football.\" Furthermore, he advised them that \"some of the alleged verbally abusive or demeaning behaviors probably occur in every football program. It is part of the 'football culture.' There is, of course, an imprecise line between training practices that aggressively push players to the limit and are acceptable, and practices that most reasonable persons would deem to be physical and/or emotional abusive conduct.'\"\nAsked about Loh's email, Maryland spokesperson Katie Lawson said: \"The president acknowledges that athletic programs are by their nature demanding and intense, and he asked commission members to investigate if Maryland's program crosses a line into destructive or abusive, which is absolutely unacceptable. President Loh has been clear that if such behavior did exist here, it will not be tolerated.\"\nAfter assuming ownership of the investigation two days later, the board of regents added five more members to the commission, including former Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich and Tom McMillen, the former Terps' basketball star who served three terms in Congress.\nIn expanding the panel, the regents faced the delicate task of appointing people who are sufficiently knowledgeable about football and the school but not too partisan.\n\"Ideally, you want somebody who has more than a passing familiarity with that space and the cultures that exist in that space,\" said a veteran college sports administrator, who requested anonymity so he could speak candidly about the process. \"At the same time, that can cause people to be apologists for all that behavior. That's one of the inherent challenges. I know some of the people on the Maryland committee. They're good people, but many are affiliated with the University of Maryland.\nRichard Legon, president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, said the composition of the Maryland commission on its face appears sound.\n\"I think if you have a former a member of Congress, a former governor, other prestigious leaders who are connected or not to the institution, what you can get to is an outcome with a high degree of credibility,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, credibility allows the board to put greater stock into the recommendations and take whatever actions they're going to take.\"\nThe web of relationships surrounding the Maryland probe is thorny and highlights several areas of possible concern. The eight commission members, who will be compensated for their work, either declined to comment or did not respond to requests to comment.\nLoh made Alex Williams, a well-respected retired U.S. District judge, one of his three initial appointees to the commission. Williams is the founder, chief executive and namesake of a center focused on justice and ethics housed within the university's school of behavioral and social sciences.\nPrior to joining the commission, Williams had served as a pro bono personal advisor to Loh following the death of Richard Collins III, a 23-year-old student at nearby Bowie State University, who was killed on Maryland's College Park campus in May 2017.\nDon Scheeler, past president of the Terrapin Club, left his name off a letter in support of Durkin that was sent last month to the regents from the Champions Club, a group of high-level sports boosters. His brother, Charles Scheeler, was another of the three commission members appointed by Loh.\nCharles Scheeler is a Baltimore-based attorney at the law firm DLA Piper, who previously served as the \"independent monitor\" charged with tracking Penn State's implementation of recommendations made in the report that followed the Jerry Sandusky scandal.\nHe also was a top deputy for Sen. George Mitchell a decade ago in the exhaustive investigation into performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Scheeler and his associates at DLA Piper have done much of the commission's investigative legwork behind the scenes.\nAsked about the inclusion of Williams and Scheeler, a spokesman said in a statement to The Post: \"Both have the objectivity and talent to contribute greatly to an impartial investigation of the culture of the University of Maryland, College Park football program.\n\"But they are only two of the eight member independent commission, which is comprised of individuals with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, from both in Maryland and outside the state,\" the statement continued. \"The commission's membership is sufficiently large, fair-minded and diverse in perspective to effectively follow the facts wherever they may lead.\"\nIn addition to Ehrlich and McMillen, the other commission members are retired U.S. District Court Judge Ben Legg; Doug Williams, the former Redskins quarterback who serves as the senior vice president of player personnel for the team; Bonnie Bernstein, an alumnus of the school and veteran sports broadcaster; and Frederick Azar, the chief of staff at Campbell Clinic Orthopaedics in Memphis.\nIt's not known how hands-on all eight of the commission members have been. Two of the eight commission members live outside the area, and others have demanding, full-time jobs.\n\"I think the vast majority of them will have had some hands-on experience,\" Caret said in an interview last week. \"I don't know if they've met face to face or not. I know they've all talked.\"\nA spokesman for the regents said that once the commission has completed its examination, it will share its findings with the board of regents, which will then \"make whatever decisions are necessary to better safeguard and support all students and student-athletes.\" The board of regents is made up of 17 unpaid members who oversee Maryland's system of 12 colleges. With the exception of one student representative, each member is appointed by the governor and can serve a maximum of two five-year terms.\nBarry Gossett is a vice chair of the board of regents and also one of the most influential athletic boosters the school has ever known. He donated $10 million in 2007 to build the football program's \"team house,\" which bears his name, and this spring pledged more than $21 million - one of the largest donations the school has ever received - to a center focused on athletes' academic studies.\n\"From a donor standpoint, I kind of stand behind DJ and his program and what he has been doing,\" Gossett told The Post in an interview before the university placed the coach on leave.\nGossett did not respond to requests to comment last week. He had been tending recently to his wife, Mary, who died Monday. The couple have been donors to the school since 1971, championing causes both in and outside of athletics.\n\"Barry Gossett is a highly regarded member of the Maryland community who has served, and continues to serve, the state in countless ways,\" a spokesman for the board of regents said in an email last week. \"At the same time, he is only one of 17 members of the Board of Regents, which will receive the findings of the independent commission.\"\nLike Don Scheeler, Gossett left his name off the Champions Club letter supporting Durkin.\nThe board doesn't typically play a role in personnel decisions at the system's schools, though it does have oversight over Loh, who has led the state's flagship university since 2010.\n\"The board obviously can have influence on the president,\" Caret said.\nStephen Ross, a Penn State sports law professor who directs a cross-campus center on sports issues, said the pre-existing relationships on these investigative bodies aren't usually as important as the underlying motivation behind the appointment.\nHe says there are scenarios where those pre-existing ties could undermine an investigation but others in which they could lend credibility, diversify the commission and appease stakeholders in the event of a critical report.\n\"To me, an ad hoc committee designed to deal with a major public relations problem is itself an exercise in strategic communication,\" he said.\nThere is no rulebook for such investigations and schools can pursue them on their own terms. Similar external examinations have been conducted at schools such as Ohio State, Michigan State and Penn State, facing widespread criticism from some corners unhappy with different facets of the respective probes or findings.\nThe Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges issued a formal statement to schools in 2009 saying \"it is time for all [governing] boards to re-examine how they exercise their oversight responsibilities.\" The organization urged governing bodies, such as Maryland's board of regents, to refrain \"from fostering personal relationships with the athletics director or coaches,\" and urging them to \"exercise appropriate oversight while avoiding micromanagement, viewing athletics with a dispassionate perspective.\"\n\"We don't want them running college sports,\"Legon said, \"but we want them to recognize the buck stops with them.\"",
        "Last Tuesday, a farm-to-table subscription service called Local Roots NYC dropped off boxes at pickup spots in New York City including a cafe, a brew pub and the offices of BuzzFeed.\nAlongside locally grown rainbow chard, romaine lettuce and beets, some members got bottles of olive oil from Italy or bars of chocolate and bags of dried pasta, both Brooklyn-made. From Rustic Roots, an organic-food delivery service in the tristate area, members could receive fruit boxes stacked with oranges, pineapples and avocados.\nAlthough both companies use the term \u201cC.S.A.,\u201d community-supported agriculture, to describe their service, the presence of a middleman between the farmer and the customer is precisely what traditional C.S.A.s are designed to avoid. And since olives and oranges do not grow in this region, those products provide no direct income to local farmers, precisely the people the C.S.A. was invented to benefit.\nCommunity-supported agriculture was originally defined by a very particular relationship between a farm and its customers. Starting in the 1980s (earlier in Europe and Japan), members banded together to support a nearby farm with an upfront financial commitment to buy its produce.\nIt was a private transaction in which all the money went directly to the farmer. It did not rely on distributors or brick-and-mortar stores, and it gave farmers a crucial infusion of cash for the winter, used to buy seeds, repair equipment and expand into new growing methods.\nThe goal was for C.S.A. farmers and members to build a mutually supportive long-term relationship. Members would get straight-from-the-farm produce from a farmer they knew and trusted, and farmers would get financial stability.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other customer that pays you 100 percent, in advance, year after year,\u201d said Maggie Wood, an owner of Golden Earthworm Farm on the North Fork of Long Island. Ms. Wood\u2019s farm is entirely supported by its 2,150 C.S.A. members.\nWhat to consider before joining a farm share or community-supported agriculture group.\nAs demand for local and organic produce has ballooned in the last five years, so have other ideas for connecting farmers to customers. Now, online hubs are using sophisticated distribution technology to snap into the food chain, often using \u201cC.S.A.\u201d to describe what they deliver.\nThe term is not regulated in most states, so companies can define it as they wish. Peapod, the online shopping service owned by the international grocery giant Ahold, delivers farm-sourced boxes throughout the Northeast; FreshDirect offers a variety of C.S.A. options in and around New York City.\nAs the \u201cfarm share\u201d concept has spread, the C.S.A. has become just another part of the sprawling, messy modern system of knowing where your food comes from and choosing what you want to eat.\nThe opportunity for confusion is of enormous concern to many farmers in the New York region. Depending on how and where these new businesses buy their produce, consumers can receive all the benefits of C.S.A. membership, while the farmers get only a fraction. Some farmers say that after years of steady growth, their C.S.A. memberships have dropped since the arrival of services like Local Roots or Farmigo.\n\u201cAt first it seemed like these services were going to be great for us,\u201d said Eve Kaplan-Walbrecht, an owner of Garden of Eve farm on the North Fork of Long Island. Some of them supplied software management programs and marketing tools; others offered premium prices close to farmers\u2019 market rates; others picked up the produce instead of requiring farmers to deliver to a central warehouse.\nBut the drawbacks can outweigh the benefits. Some say that these hubs have siphoned off their members, partly by offering a more convenient product, but also by blurring the definition of terms like \u201cC.S.A.\u201d and \u201cfarm share,\u201d so that customers believe they are directly supporting local farms with their purchases when they might not.\nMs. Kaplan-Walbrecht said that her membership had dropped from a high of 900 around 2012 to 600 today. Golden Earthworm, Katchkie Farm in Kinderhook, N.Y., and many other local farmers agree that after years of steady growth, they have been struggling to retain old members and attract new ones. And that to compete with the delivery services, they are scrambling to find sources for bread, cheese, fruit, meat, eggs and other add-ons that customers want.\n\u201cDo consumers even know that when they sign up for one of these fake C.S.A.s, sometimes it doesn\u2019t benefit local farmers any more than if they shop at the supermarket?\u201d Ms. Kaplan-Walbrecht asked.\nProbably not. The organic farm boxes you buy online may or may not be local. Local farm boxes may or may not be organic. The farmers may or may not be paid more than wholesale prices. And customers may or may not care.\nTaking the time to tease out whether buying granola made in Brooklyn qualifies as supporting local agriculture can test the patience of consumers. Services like Local Roots offer an alluring simplicity.\nMs. Ying said that the more food options her customers have, the more likely they are to remain in the C.S.A., which in turn sustains the 15 local farms from which Local Roots buys. Traditional C.S.A.s have a high turnover rate; many people simply find the system too inflexible for their needs.\nHepworth is an example of an organic farm that benefits from increased options for farmers, participating in a new distribution system alongside its farmers\u2019 market, restaurant and wholesale businesses.\nNow that local food has become big business, Target and Walmart are trying to get a piece of it, and even Amazon is delivering locally grown kale. This new demand has been a boon for many farmers across the country, especially large-scale farmers equipped to sell in bulk; new sales channels have been opened that they could never have accessed independently.\nSmall farmers say they have no problem with new markets for local food; they just don\u2019t want them to be called C.S.A.s.\nPaula Lukats is the program director of Just Food, an advocacy and education group for local agriculture in New York State. She confirmed that after a peak in 2010, memberships in community-supported agriculture groups have been going down \u201cacross the board.\u201d For the sake of clarity, she said, she wishes that middlemen would stop using the term \u201cC.S.A.\u201d altogether.\nBut in interviews with farmers, policy makers and entrepreneurs, all parties agreed that for fragile local food systems to strengthen, consumers will have to be offered more choice and control over what they eat than is possible with a traditional C.S.A.\nThe real issues facing C.S.A. farms and the food system are not confined to the New York metropolitan area. Judith Redmond, an owner of Full Belly Farm in Yolo, Calif., said that membership in its C.S.A., one of the oldest and biggest in California, has dropped this season after holding steady at 1,200 (with a perpetual waiting list) since 1992.\nMs. Redmond belongs to the Community Alliance With Family Farmers, a group that was instrumental in having the phrase \u201cCommunity-Supported Agriculture\u201d codified by the California legislature, effective in 2014. It is the only state that has done so.\nSome of them have proved to have a short life span. In 2015, Good Eggs suddenly ended deliveries in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and New Orleans after just one year; Farmstr, started with much fanfare in Seattle in 2013, also closed up shop in 2015.\nAnd in just the last two weeks, 15,000 households in New York, New Jersey, Seattle and Northern California that subscribed to C.S.A.s through a company called Farmigo received boxes that would be their last, as the company abruptly shut down its food distribution operation \u2014 in the middle of the harvest season \u2014 to return to its core business: software.\nFarmigo, which started deliveries in 2013, fueled its rapid expansion with more than $25 million of venture capital, raised on the strength of a food distribution software platform that the founder, Benzi Ronen, claimed would eventually replace supermarkets altogether.\nBut the real-world logistics of washing, packing, refrigerating, distributing and delivering those items to 400 locations proved overwhelming. So Farmigo members lost out on this growing season, and scores of Farmigo farmers were left with fields and trailers full of unsold produce.\nStill, Mr. Ronen said he did not believe that traditional C.S.A.s are the answer.",
        "The justice secretary had admitted this morning that he was giving \"further consideration\" to the case for public interest after reports over the weekend suggested reasons for the move.\nVenables, 27, was ten years old when he murdered toddler James Bulger in 1993. After being released the Ministry of Justice confirmed he was returned to jail following a \"breach of licence conditions\" on Wednesday.\nJames' mother Denise Fergus said she had a \"right to know\" why the recall had taken place.\nBut this afternoon Mr Straw told the Commons that it would not be in the public interest to make further revelations.\n\"It is critical that if charges do follow it is possible to hold a fair trial - fair for the defence and fair for the prosecution,\" he told MPs.\n\"Our motivation is solely to ensure that serious allegations are properly investigated and that justice is done. No one in this country would want anything other.\"\nMr Straw's earlier comments echoed home secretary Alan Johnson's suggestion that the public had a \"right to know\" last week.\n\"It is better to be cautious. Above all, it is not for ministers to run a criminal trial process,\" Mr Straw said earlier.\n\"I think it's pretty well known that my overriding instinct in public life is to give as much information as possible as early as possible - not to sit on things. There has to be a good reason for doing what I'm doing at the moment.\"\nThis afternoon he insisted that he and Mr Johnson were in complete agreement on the issue, telling the Commons: \"The home secretary and I are in exactly the same place on this.\"\nVenables abducted two-year-old James from a shopping centre in Bootle, Liverpool, with Robert Thompson in February 1993 before they beat him to death and laid his body on a railway track.\nAccording to the Sunday Mirror, Venables was taken back into custody on allegations revolving around indecent images of children.\nThe Sun yesterday also claimed that Venables had been arrested on suspicion of a serious sexual offence. It has emerged since then that an injunction has been obtained against the paper to prevent it from publishing the specific alleged offences.\nMrs Fergus told ITV1's This Morning on Monday her head was \"all over the place\" over the developments.\n\"I do not want to prejudice a trial but I have the right to know,\" she said.\n\"I want to know why he, I can't even bring myself to say his name, has been recalled to prison.\n\"If he [Mr Straw] can't tell me now, then I want to know after any criminal proceedings against him have finished.\n\"I can't eat again. I have pulled my kids out of school. It has brought it all flooding back.\"",
        "And that's why the United States can't win.\nIn announcing last week that more U.S. forces were headed to Afghanistan, President Donald Trump remarked that \u201cthe American people are weary of war without victory.\u201d He\u2019s right about the weariness. But that very weariness is encouraged by the widespread belief that Afghanistan is the kind of war in which there is going to be a moment of victory, if only the American people support the war a little longer. And that is to misunderstand the nature of the conflict in Afghanistan.\nEver since the Taliban government was toppled in late 2001, the heart of the strategic problem that has confronted the United States and its allies in Afghanistan has been the definition of victory: How does this end? We would all be better off if we first asked what \u201cthis\u201d is. While Afghanistan is a war of sorts, it is not the sort of war in which there is likely to be a decisive moment of victory. Rather, Afghanistan is best described as an armed policing operation.\nHence in Afghanistan, security forces regularly collect evidence from the battlefield: weapons, spent bullet cases, parts from improvised explosive devices, documents, cell phones, swab tests for explosive residue, and so on. Why? Because without evidence there will be no conviction in an Afghan court, and the alleged insurgent will walk away (assuming he doesn\u2019t bribe his way out after capture, as happens all too often).\nThis summarizes a categorical difference between internal law enforcement operations and interstate \u201cconventional\u201d war. The idea of impounding enemy tanks for use at trial or scouring enemy bunkers for spent bullet cases to put in evidence bags during, say, the Persian Gulf War would be ridiculous because, in that context, the enemy is not a criminal.\nThe categorical distinction between internal and interstate war is straightforward. What is surprising, therefore, is how far the distinction is ignored in the expectation that decisive victory is nonetheless available in internal conflict.\nIn a domestic context, everyone understands that policing is a continual activity. The idea is constantly to maintain order. There is no moment of victory as such but, rather, an ambition to achieve and maintain relative \u201cstability,\u201d which is only ever a provisional state.\nTo think about the conflict in Afghanistan as an armed policing operation (in my book I call it \u201carmed politics,\u201d but it\u2019s the same business of enforcing the writ of a government over its own state) makes sense historically. Take for example the British experience of policing the other side of the lawless \u201cNorth-West Frontier\u201d between what is today Pakistan and Afghanistan against rebellious Pashtun (then called Pathan) tribes. Virtually not a single year passed between 1849 and 1947 without some kind of large military expedition to quell unrest.\nBefore 1900 alone, there were 60 such campaigns. In 1897-1898, a general rebellion of the Pathan tribes required the deployment of a 44,000-strong British force to put it down \u2014 the largest British field force ever deployed in Asia to that point. But this operation is not remembered within the chronology of any war. Rather, the action of that year is known simply as the Tirah campaign. The key point is that there was no end point to this century of continual armed policing activity. 1947 was merely the date the British left. Thousands of Pakistani troops remain engaged in policing the same tribal regions today.\nIn sum, the notion of \u201cvictory\u201d in Afghanistan tends to mislead because it shoehorns the language of conventional war into internal conflict, in which outcomes are usually gauged in terms of relative stability, not decisive victory. That said, decisive victory in internal conflict is sometimes possible, typically when the insurgent force gets so powerful as to field a conventional force and the distinction between conventional and internal war breaks down.\nIn Afghanistan, that would mean the Taliban converting from a guerrilla to a conventional force in an effort to take and hold big cities but would thus risk presenting a conventional military target that could be defeated in open battle. But the Taliban are unlikely to make that switch, since they would likely lose in conventional battle to U.S.-backed Afghan forces. The Taliban leadership will not likely repeat the mistake the mujahideen made when they switched from guerrilla to conventional war to take over Afghanistan. They were badly defeated at the Battle of Jalalabad by Soviet-backed Afghan forces in 1989, which kept the then-Afghan government in power until the USSR itself collapsed in 1991.\nLet\u2019s be clear: We\u2019re losing in Afghanistan, and the Taliban are winning. But as Field Marshal William Slim once said, \u201cIn battle nothing is ever as good or as bad as the first reports of excited men would have it.\u201d In other words, stay calm and look at things objectively. The fact remains that while we can\u2019t win decisively, neither can the Taliban so long as the United States remains in Afghanistan, as that prevents the Taliban switching to a conventional posture.\nOne role of any long-term U.S. force is to make clear to the Taliban that they can\u2019t win and so ultimately encourage a negotiated outcome. What this would look like has to be up to Afghans, not Westerners, or the settlement will lack legitimacy. But the outlines of any deal would likely be about the southern and eastern Pashtun areas having a more autonomous place within a more decentralized Afghan state.\nBut U.S. forces have another role to play in Afghanistan \u2014 to pressure the Afghan government itself to reform. Where people support the Afghan government, it\u2019s not because it is great but because the Taliban are more despised. Realistically, the Afghan government will not reform unless it feels compelled to. To that extent, it is right that any U.S. force should remain small enough to leave the burden of the military fight to Kabul.\nThe new U.S. Afghanistan strategy \u2014 crafted by Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster \u2014 by providing more troops to assist the Afghan government while proposing no timetable for their drawdown, appears to be broadly in line with this view and avoids commitment to the notion of decisive victory. It\u2019s not a strategy to get excited about, and that\u2019s a good thing.",

Symantec's audit logging mechanism must also be scrutinised to ensure it is protected from modifications and deletions as well as tampering.\nThe results of the audits and assessments may not be made public however, if Symantec considers the information confidental.\nFrom June 1 2016, all Symantec-issued certificates will be required to support Google's Certificate Transparency mechanism.\nIf after that date newly-issued Symantec certificates do not conform to the Chromium Certificate Transparency policy, Sleevi said it could result in Chrome and other Google products displaying warning interstitials."

It continues, \"Therefore, it is important to carefully inspect the hubcap, axle shaft end and retaining nut for system identification.\" There should be a label or identification plate stating: \"Warning: Removal Voids Warranty,\" \"Caution: Removal of Long Life Bearings will Void Axle Warranty\" or \"Warning: Do Not Service Hub and Bearing System.\" If there is no label, you have an older design.\nIf you are buying a new truck or selecting between several used ones, try to specify unitized, factory assembled wheel ends. They will save you a great deal of work, and could help prevent accidents.\nMost existing wheel end assemblies are not unitized. They still require periodic servicing and it is absolutely critical that adjustments must be within a specific range. The assemblies contain a seal to hold lubrication in the parts that rotate with the wheel. They consist of two single row, widespread, tapered roller bearing assemblies and an adjusting mechanism, which is a single nut held in place with a cotter pin, a tang-type locking adjustment nut or a spindle nut.\nThe most common type of wheel end assembly is the one shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B. In this example, the wheel end assembly 10 includes a hub 12, a pair of axles 14 and 16, a pair of wheels 18, 20 and 22, a pair of ball joints 24, 26, 28 and 30, a pair of tie rods 32, 34, 36, 38 and 40, a pair of steering knuckles 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148,",
        "In the past few weeks, senators have been so focused on squabbling over the nomination of Chuck Hagel as secretary of Defense that it seemed like John Brennan would have a relatively easy time being confirmed as director of the CIA. However, following NBC News\u2019s release yesterday of a Justice Department white paper that outlines the administration\u2019s legal justification for conducting drone strikes against Americans suspected of terrorism, Brennan\u2019s nomination is quickly morphing into a showdown over the Obama administration\u2019s drone policy. Now the New York Times has added more fuel to the controversy, revealing that the United States has a secret CIA drone base in Saudi Arabia that\u2019s used to conduct strikes in neighboring Yemen.\nThe Saudi base, which was constructed two years ago, was first used to launch the drones that killed American-born Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki. Though much of the debate has focused on the targeting of U.S. citizens, only four Americans have been killed in U.S. airstrikes in Yemen since 2002. By comparison, at least 24 people have already been killed by U.S. drones in Yemen this year, and since the campaign started more than 3,000 militants and civilians have been killed in strikes in Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia.\nAs the the White House\u2019s chief counterterrorism adviser, Brennan is the main coordinator of the terrorist \u201ckill list\u201d and oversees the drone strikes conducted by both the military and the CIA. In addition to his role overseeing the drone program, he also serves as the president\u2019s point man on foreign policy issues, including the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\nBrennan has come under fire from some members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who have accused him of failing to disclose information about the drone base during his confirmation hearing last month. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the committee\u2019s top Democrat, told reporters yesterday that she believes Brennan should recuse himself from any oversight of the drone program because of his ties to the CIA.\n\u201cI think we need to be very careful about whether or not there are conflicts of interest here,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if Mr. Brennan will be able to do that.\u201d\nFeinstein\u2019s comments were echoed by Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO), another member of the intelligence panel. \u201cIt\u2019",
        "Risks to the world economy remain to the downside and include sharply weaker global growth and a sudden change to expectations regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate path, Societe Generale warned on Tuesday.\nThe French bank also said there was still a 30 percent chance of an economic \"hard landing\" for China, in its quarterly economic outlook.\n\"The potential for policy errors in China is substantial, and all the more so since a new bubble appears to be building in the property market,\" Societe Generale analysts, led by Patrick Legland and Michala Marcussen, said in the report.\n\"The authorities are clearly keen to start recognizing and tackling the mountain of non-performing loans. The approach will be one of trial and error, with the downside risks implied in the name.\"\nA sharper-than-expected deceleration in the world's second-largest economy could reverberate around the world. SocGen termed it a \"black swan\" \u2014 a metaphor for surprise events that severely affect the world.\nThe bank forecasts China's economy will grow by 6.5 percent in this year, in line with consensus estimates.\nSocGen said uncertainty about Europe's political direction was another risk to the world economy. The near-election of a far-right president in Austria this month and the U.K.'s upcoming referendum on leaving the European Union have brought politics in the region into sharper relief.\nThe bank said there was a 50 percent chance of a Greek exit from the euro zone, which would lead to a sharp fall in the value of the country's currency, the drachma. Greece has been struggling to meet its debt repayments.\nSocGen also said there was a 40 percent chance of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, which would cause a sharp drop in the value of the pound.\nSocGen expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least three times in 2017, but only if inflation rises above 2.5 percent. It sees the Fed raising rates twice in 2018, once in December and again in March.\nSocGen said it expected oil prices to average $50 per barrel next year, up from $45 this year.\n(Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Andrew Callus and Hugh Lawson)\nRead the original article on Reuters.

        "Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 call to ban \u201cfracking\u201d advanced Tuesday in the House and Senate as environmentalists argue the proposals don\u2019t go far enough and the petroleum industry fights to allow the controversial drilling technique.\nWith the groups opposing the bills for different reasons, some lawmakers were left explaining their support as the House Agriculture & Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee voted 10-2 to ban \u201chydraulic fracturing\u201d for oil and natural gas (HB 7029). Later, the Senate Innovation, Industry, and Technology Committee narrowly approved a broader version (SB 7064) that includes provisions on drilling in the Everglades.\nThe acidizing technique uses many of the same chemicals as in fracking, but it dissolves rocks with acid instead of fracturing them with pressurized liquid.\nThe narrow definition is not included in the Senate version. But the Senate bill seeks to provide oil-drilling protections for the Everglades. That move is a reaction to an ongoing legal battle over a Broward County landowner\u2019s plan to drill an exploratory oil well on about five acres in the Everglades. The exploratory well would not involve fracking.\nStill, environmentalists remain opposed to the House and Senate proposals and the possibility of allowing the matrix acidizing technique. Environmentalists contend that fracking threatens Florida\u2019s water supplies and can affect agricultural production and cause environmental damage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fracking ban until all forms of hydraulic fracturing are banned,\u201d said Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-Orlando), who sponsored HB 7029. \u201cWe need to make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can to protect our environment.\u201d\nRep. Randy Fine (R-Palm Harbor) said he supports banning the acidizing technique because it could contaminate drinking water sources.\n\u201cI think we should be very careful about what we\u2019re putting into our aquifers,\u201d Fine said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do something like this, you\u2019ve got to make sure it\u2019s done properly.\u201d\nFine also noted that the state has already banned the use of certain chemicals used in fracking.\nSen. Annette Taddeo (R-Naples) said she was concerned about the potential impact on agriculture.\n\u201cWe have to look at the whole picture,\u201d Taddeo",
        "The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation.\nIdeally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security \u2013external or internal \u2013with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy. National Intelligence cannot be competitively patriotic in relation to the Political Executive unless it is driven to a point where it had to confront the elected leadership on the latter's credentials as the guardian of national security.\nHow does one take a judgement call from outside on the ongoing 'conflict' between FBI \u2013which in US performs the counter-intelligence function against threats to national security- and Donald Trump, that kept on escalating even after the latter had been designated as the President-elect? The discordance between the two sprang up when the agency let it be known to the entire world that Putin's Russia had 'interfered' with the electoral system of US with the motive of helping the Republican campaign. FBI allowed the political furore to develop around the issue to a level where it was suggested that those in charge of Trump campaign might be in a clandestine collusion with Russian intelligence services.\nIt is important to note here that there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that Trump campaign officials colluded with the Russians. It is equally important to note that there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that Trump himself colluded with the Russians. In fact, he has repeatedly denied any such thing. What we have seen instead is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and their media allies to paint Trump as a Kremlin stooge who is being manipulated by Vladimir Putin to help his re-election bid in 2020.\nIn other words, the Democrats are trying to make Trump look like a Russian agent while at the same time making him appear as if he is being manipulated by Putin to help his re-election bid in 2020. This is a classic case of double standards. If the Democrats were so concerned about the integrity of American elections, why did they allow Hillary Clinton to win the 2016 presidential election despite her having been found guilty of multiple felonies relating to her handling of classified information?",

        "After trumpeting the completion of the $882 million West Building addition Thursday, a top McCormick Place official disclosed preliminary plans for another jumbo expansion that could include a 1,500-room hotel located on the block directly north of the newly opened hall.\nThe Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority board on Tuesday is expected to consider exercising its eminent domain powers to condemn the block, clearing the way for a project that would more than double the convention center's on-site hotel offerings, Ted Tetzlaff, chairman of the board, said in an interview. Other elements could include more parking for McCormick Place, restaurants and other businesses.\nThis bold but risk-laden project would be in addition to the planned 600-room expansion of the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place, an 800-room property owned by the authority, which is known as McPier. The agency is expected to request development proposals for the Hyatt expansion shortly, with a contract likely to be awarded late this year or early next.\n\"Our big customers want big blocks of hotel rooms, some of which need to be at the convention facility,\" Tetzlaff said after ribbon-cutting ceremonies for the West Building. Even with another 1,500 rooms or more on the campus, Chicago still would lag many competitors in terms of on-site hotel availability, he said. Rosemont, for example, has 8,000 rooms near its convention hall, he said.\n\"We believe we're going to be able to fill all those rooms,\" Tetzlaff said. \"It's just a matter of how quickly we can do it.\"\nTetzlaff declined to say how much the new hotel would cost or when construction might begin. He also wouldn't say whether the authority would use eminent domain to take over the block, saying only that \"we are looking at all options.\"\nThe authority owns the land where the proposed hotel would be built on the southwest corner of North Michigan Avenue and South Dearborn Street. It acquired the block from the city of Chicago for $2.5 million in 2006.\nThe authority has been working on the West Building since 2009, when it purchased the former Sears Tower site for $1.4 billion. The building was designed by architect Frank Gehry and features a glass facade that opens up to the sky.\nThe West Building will house the convention center's largest ballroom, which will seat 2,200 people.

Prominent among these, are organic farming, nature farming, angara, rishi krishi, panch kavya, biodynamic farming, etc.\nThe most outstanding aspect of biodynamic farming is that none of the inputs are purchased from outside. According to senior scientist, Dr RA Ram, Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), 500 g of compost developed through a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccow pat pit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 obtained at a marginal cost, is sufficient for an acre of farm land.\nFor a similar sized field, comparatively, 4-5 bags of relatively expensive urea will be required. In addition to this, the soil usually absorbs only 46 per cent of the nitrogen released, and the rest is wasted. Leeching causes the formation of nitrous oxide that has been linked with the destruction of the ozone layer, and nitrates are responsible for the pollution of groundwater.\nA national level symposium on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOrganic farming in horticulture for sustainable production\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was organised by CISH on Friday, and was inaugurated by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The chief minister said that the state government had already launched a campaign to encourage farmers to adopt organic farming. He also announced that the state government would provide Rs 10,000 to every farmer who adopts organic farming.\nDr Ram said that there was no need to buy fertilisers or pesticides when one could grow crops without using any chemical. He said that organic farming was not only environmentally friendly, but also economically viable.\nHe said that it was possible to grow vegetables, fruits, grains, pulses, cereals, oilseeds, legumes, spices, herbs, medicinal plants, etc., without using chemical fertilisers or pesticides.\nDr Ram said that organic farming could be practised on a large scale in Uttar Pradesh if proper awareness programmes were carried out about its benefits. He said that the state government was planning to set up nurseries in all districts so that people could learn how to grow their own food.\nDr Ram said that",

Rough Cut (no reporter narration).\nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: Prime Minister David Cameron urged parliament to vote on Wednesday (December 2) to approve British air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria after months of wrangling over whether enough opposition Labour lawmakers would back military action. \"The question before the house today, is how we keep the British people safe from the threat posed by ISIL. Let me be clear from the outset, this is not about whether we want to fight terrorism, it is about it is about how best we do that,\" he said at the start of a 10-hour debate due to culminate in a vote at around 2100 GMT. He added: \"The question is this - do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat and do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands from where they are plotting to kill British people, or do we sit back and wait for them?\" However, Cameron faced a possible stiffening of opposition in Labour ranks after media reports he urged his Conservative Party lawmakers at a private meeting late on Tuesday not to vote with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \"and a bunch of terrorist sympathisers\". Many lawmakers demanded Cameron apologise for his remark. Cameron has said he believes British warplanes, which have been bombing Islamic State targets in Iraq for more than a year, should also be tackling the group in Syria.\n(Reporting by Kylie MacLellan; editing by Stephen Addison)\n((kylie.maclellan@thomsonreuters.com)(+44 207 542 3326)) Keywords: BRITAIN/ISLAMIC STRIKES\n(C) Reuters 2012.

        "A school management and a section of residents at a village in Umaria district have accused union minister for textiles Smriti Irani of entering in such a land deal at their village, which deprives them of their right on the land.\nUmaria is more than 500 kilometers east of Bhopal. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve close to the land in dispute attracts a good number of wildlife lovers every year.\nAs per the information reaching here the district administration has found no illegality in the matter so far.\nEarlier, the villagers of Kuchwahi too submitted an application to the SDM concerned in January this year alleging that the traditional route of the village had been blocked by \u2018Smriti Rani\u2019. The passage of the students from Narva Mohalla to the school too had been blocked by her.\nTalking to Hindustan Times deputy sarpanch of Kuchwahi village Shaukhi Lal Singh said, \u201cWe lodged a complaint to the collector Abhishek Singh a couple of months back. He assigned the matter to sub divisional magistrate (SDM) JP Yadav. But when he did nothing we had to lodge a complaint on the CM Helpline\u201d, he said.\nThe revenue department documents available with HT, however, suggest the land adjacent to the school was purchased by one Markaz Hospitality Private Ltd (authorized person Amit Kumra), which the school management and residents claim belongs to them.\nAccording to the records available with the revenue department, Markaz Hospitality Pvt Ltd bought the land in March 2017 for \u20b91.5 crore. It was later sold for \u20b92.25 crore in October 2018.\nThe villagers claimed that they were not given any notice before the sale took place. They also alleged that the land was encroached upon during the construction of the school building.\nWhen asked about the allegations levelled against her, Smriti Irani said, \u201cI am aware of the issue. I will look into it and take appropriate action.\u201d\nShe added that she would visit the area soon.\nFirst Published: Jul 19, 2019 00:00 IST\nFirst Published: Jul 19, 2019 00:00 IST\n(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

        "Cami Davre won her fourth consecutive title in both the 800 and 1,600, leaving the door open for an even more impressive feat on the second day of the state track meet in La Crosse.\nThe name Cami Davre will forever be associated with La Crosse and Memorial Stadium, where the Whitefish Bay standout has now piled up 10 state championships in her storied distance-running career.\nThere was one last loose end to tie up June 3.\nDavre, who won her fourth consecutive titles in both the 800 and 1,600 runs June 2 in the Division 1 state meet, had never competed in the 3,200 meters at state. Not surprisingly, the University of Michigan recruit handled it with poise, completing the most grueling triple on the books \u2014 the 3,200, 1,600 and 800. Only one other runner in state history has pulled off the feat of winning all three.\nHer time of 10:53.67 was two seconds ahead of Peyton Sippy of Janesville Craig. Davre said seeing her family in the stands made the moment particularly emotional.\n\"Especially my grandparents; they\u2019ve been taking me to national competitions since middle school, and that kind of opened to the door to what track is (to me),\" Davre said. \"Just saying goodbye to this experience, it\u2019s really sad. It\u2019s meant a lot to me.\"\nShe is the fifth girls athlete in Wisconsin history to win four straight state titles in the same event. The others are Mary Lou Janssen (1957-59), Joanne Schmitz (1960-62) and Carol Kowalczyk (1963-64).\nDavre's father, Mark, was also a standout high school football player in his own right. He went on to play professionally in the Canadian Football League.\n\"I always wanted to be like him,\" Cami Davre said. \"He was a great athlete, but he didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to college. So I just tried to follow in his footsteps as much as I could.\"\nIt wasn't until she started running that Cami Davre realized how much she loved the sport. She began competing in cross country and track when she was 9 years old. Her first state championship came in the 1,600 in 2010.\n\"I think it\u2019s just because I love it so much,\"",

But don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be graded.\nThe exhibit is called \u201cPulse,\u201d and it opened last week at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. It has three installations that create art by collecting visitors\u2019 biometric data. (Biometric data is information that identifies your body. A fingerprint is one example.) \u00adLozano-Hemmer uses electronic sensors to gather a person\u2019s data and project it through lights, screens and water pumps to create art. He said the purpose of this exhibit is to show people that while we have our differences, we all share a heartbeat.\n\u201cWhat I like about this is that the art is fundamentally out of my control,\u201d says Lozano-Hemmer, a Mexican Canadian artist.\n\u201cPulse Index\u201d is the first installation visitors walk into at the Hirshhorn. It is a panoramic view of 10,000 fingerprints that are collected from visitors through a microscope. When a finger is inserted in the microscope, a fingerprint scan will show up on the wall among thousands of others. Each time a scan is taken, it knocks an old one off the wall. Visitors can see how their fingerprints change over time as they move around the museum.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important for people to see themselves reflected in the work,\u201d Lozano-\u00adHemmer says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about what you look like, it\u2019s also about who you are.\u201d\nThe second installation is called \u201cPulse Waveform.\u201d It is a video projection that shows a pulse waveform projected onto a screen. The pulse waveform changes every few seconds depending on how many fingers are pressed against the screen.\nThe third installation is called \u201cFingerprint Scanner.\u201d It is a digital display that projects a fingerprint image onto a screen. Visitors can press their finger against the screen to take a print.\nLozano-\u00adHemmer said he wanted to make sure his exhibits were accessible to everyone, so he designed them with different levels of difficulty.",
        "What does a Tory eurosceptic look like? Loud chalk-stripe, a flash of red braces and the faintest whiff of a lunch-time gander at the Members\u2019 wine list. Right? Wrong.\nThe economic trauma of the crash of 2008 is demanding that just as Conservative modernisation needs to be rebooted to suit the new Age of Austerity \u2013 with a focus on bold economic reformism to tackle welfare traps, worklessness and failing schools instead of the cultural gesturism of early modernisation \u2013 so too the crisis demands a rebooted euroscepticism. The Tory Party in Parliament has been transformed by the arrival of the Cameron generation: more entrepreneurial, impatient, ambitious and global in our outlook. In our 30s and 40\u2019s, \u2018Thatcher\u2019s children\u2019 have built careers in the world transformed by the reforms of the 80s and the enterprise economics she unleashed to such effect. Today\u2019s Euroscepticism reflects that transformation. Far from the little England xenophobia of UKIP, the new generation of modern Conservative Euro-sceptics are bound by an entrepreneurial frustration at a European project which is too introverted and bureaucratic to win any Global Race.\nAs a co-chair of today\u2019s Fresh Start Conference for EU Reform \u2013 a major gathering in London of over 200 European national and business leaders from across the continent \u2013 I know that todays euroscepticism is fundamentally different to that which haunted the leaders of the Thatcherite right in the 1980s and 90s. It is not driven by nostalgia for the past; it is driven by a sense that Europe has failed to live up to its own potential. And it is fuelled by a growing sense that Britain\u2019s place in the world is under threat from the rise of China and the United States.\nIt is no coincidence that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the Maastricht Treaty, which created the European Union. It was a momentous day in British history when we joined a club whose founding principles were set out in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789. But it was also a momentous day in the history of the European Union itself. For the first time since the Second World War, Europe had a common currency, a single market, a common foreign policy, a common army and a common budget. This was the dawn of a new era in European integration.\nAnd yet, despite",

He's one of a number in your caucus who believes that this party is doomed under Julia Gillard. Under all the available evidence, isn't that correct?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well I think \"doomed\" is very emotive language. I think we have been having a tough time electorally, but certainly the sort of distraction that we've seen over the last few days doesn't help that. I think we've got an excellent record to talk about and we've got a clear vision for the future. And I hope that on Monday, if this ballot goes ahead, that there is a decisive victory and then we can all go back to doing what we went into Parliament to do, which is serve our communities.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: But you can't convince the community that that's what you're doing, that you are a good government. You can't even convince, it would appear, one third of your own caucus.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: No, I'm not going to be distracted by the fact that some people don't agree with my politics or my policies. I'm going to continue to focus on the issues that matter most to the Australian people.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Do you believe that the Labor Party will win the next election?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Yes, I do.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Why?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Because I think we've got a really strong team.

We've got a great Environment Minister. We've got a great Communications Minister. We've got a great Education Minister. We've got a great Transport Minister. We've got a great Defence Minister",
        "In politics, business, advocacy, and media, there are veterans on the American landscape who have the potential to make a big difference in the months ahead. Some of them are well-known; many of them are not (but should be).\nWilliam McNulty is a former Marine infantryman who later transitioned into the intelligence community. In 2010 he assumed a new mission with what would eventually become Team Rubicon, a non-profit disaster relief organization he co-founded with fellow Marine Jake Wood.\nSince then, Team Rubicon has grown considerably. The permanent staff now oversees some 16,000 volunteers who deploy wherever disaster strikes. Late this year, McNulty stepped back from the main organization to focus on an ambitious project to take TR international.\nIn 2015, with McNulty now managing director of Team Rubicon Global, look for greater impact from the five-year-old organization as it expands to support relief efforts worldwide. This franchise approach will model Team Rubicon's successes with American veterans and allow foreign military vets to continue to serve in their communities.\nAnnapolis grad and former Marine Don Faul got to his new job by way of Google and Facebook, a great training track for the task he faces as Pinterest's head of Operations.\nFaul is already making waves with his innovative approach to the site's ad units, substituting the standard way of charging an advertiser per one thousand impressions for a model that charges by the amount visitors actually click on an ad \u2013 a huge improvement over the old system, which charged advertisers based on the number of times they clicked on an ad rather than how many people actually saw it.\n\"I think we're going to see a lot more innovation,\" Faul told me. \"We've been working on this for a long time, and I'm really excited about where we're headed.\"\nFaul is also looking at ways to improve the user experience on Pinterest.

        "(CNN) - After 8 hours of deliberations Thursday, a St. Louis jury awarded $4.69 billion to 22 women who sued pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson alleging their ovarian cancer was caused by using its powder as a part of their daily feminine hygiene routine.\nThe jury award includes $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages. It's the largest verdict against the company that has sold Baby Powder and Shower to Shower brand talcum powder for decades.\nA jury ruled in Johnson & Johnson's favor in one lawsuit in California last November. In October, a judge reversed two verdicts in favor of the company. A Missouri appeals court tossed out a $55 million verdict in June citing jurisdictional issues.\nIn 2006, the International Agency for Research in Cancer, which falls under the World Health Organization, decided to classify the use of talc in the genital area as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans.\" In the US, government agencies and medical associations that track what causes cancer believe the topic needs more research to know for sure.\nThe US National Toxicology Program, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, keeps a congressionally mandated list of \"agents, substances, mixtures, and exposure circumstances that are known or reasonably anticipated to cause cancer in humans.\" Talc is not among the 248 listed; however, in 2010, when it was up for consideration to be included in the list, the agency explained that it has been used in cosmetics since at least the 1930s.\n\"We are disappointed with today\u2019s decision,\" J&J said in a statement. \"We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves against these meritless claims.\"\nJohnson & Johnson has denied any link between its products and ovarian cancer. The company says there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that talc can cause ovarian cancer.\n\"There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that talc can cause ovarian cancer,\" the company said in a statement. \"Talc does not contain asbestos, which is a known carcinogen. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that talc can cause ovarian cancer.

David Cameron wore reading glasses for the first time I have seen at prime minister's questions. I say wore, but helping his ageing eyesight was only one purpose they served.\nOf course they were not any old, off-the-peg chemist's \u00a35.99 glasses, or even something prescribed at Boots. I expect they were the very finest, lightweight lenses sprayed with a magic formula to stop them flashing in the TV lights. They were the type with a wider frame at the top than the bottom, sort of half-timbered glasses, something-or-nothing glasses, which reminded me of the ones worn by Andy Coulson.\nAnd he didn't just pop them on to read from his briefs; he deployed them like a weapon. He waved them in the air to make a point. He banged them down on the dispatch box to emphasise his attacks on Ed Miliband. Once the Labour leader had gone through all his six questions, the glasses were folded and placed on the table of the house.\nThey had been used dramatically at yet another bad-tempered session on energy prices. I would go through the arguments on either side, but it would be simpler to use tranquilliser darts to put us all to sleep.\nCameron has always had an eye for detail. When he took over as leader of the Conservative party in 2010, he set up a taskforce to find ways to save money. It was called the Energy Efficiency Taskforce (EETF), and its aim was to reduce energy consumption by 20 per cent by 2020.\nThe EETF came up with a number of ideas, such as installing smart thermostats in every home, replacing gas boilers with heat pumps, and using more efficient lightbulbs.

        "As more and more Internet-connected devices find their way into our homes and businesses, it\u2019s important to remember that they represent a security risk. The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly, and in the rush for convenience, our privacy and safety is often an afterthought. Leaving them unsecured is the digital equivalent of leaving the back door unlocked.\nThere are 5.5 million new things getting connected every day in 2016, as we head toward more than 20 billion by 2020, according to Gartner. That\u2019s an awful lot of devices. They might bring all sorts of handy new features, but, whether it\u2019s the latest cutting-edge baby monitor or a wireless doorbell camera that links to your phone, it\u2019s also a network-connected computer and should be treated as such. Here are eight tips to help you secure those IoT devices.\nThe first step is to consider what functionality you need from the device. Just because your TV or fridge can connect to the internet, doesn\u2019t mean you definitely want to hook it up. Take a good look at the features it offers and learn exactly what internet connectivity brings before you connect.\nMany Wi-Fi routers support guest networking so that visitors can connect to your network without gaining access to shared files or networked devices. This kind of separation also works well for IoT devices that have questionable security.\nIt\u2019s very important to pick strong passwords for these devices. You don\u2019t want anyone else on your network to gain access to your personal information. If you\u2019re using a password manager like LastPass or 1Password, make sure you use a unique password for each device.\nIf you\u2019re going to leave your home or business unattended for long periods of time, it\u2019s best to turn off the device when not in use. This will ensure that no one else has access to your data while you\u2019re away.\nYou should also take steps to protect your devices from being stolen or lost. Make sure they\u2019re kept out of reach of children, pets, and other people who might try to steal them.\nFinally, if you\u2019re worried about hackers or malicious software infiltrating your network, it\u2019s always a good idea to install antivirus software on your devices. It\u2019s free, easy to use, and will keep your devices safe from viruses",

        "Can you use junk to keep your home decor fresh?\n(ARA) - As colder weather arrives, you are probably looking to freshen up your home decor. While it might be counterintuitive, a great way to do this is by using items you might not otherwise have a need for - or to put it bluntly, junk.\nYou may have already heard about a growing trend called \"junking,\" which involves incorporating junk in your home decor. This allows for imaginative self-expression, endless possibilities for original design, and the ability to make your interiors stylishly green. Another plus is that you'll save a little green too, since you won't be buying as many new items.\nSue Whitney knows a thing or two about breathing new life into things some would consider junk. She's been leading the trend for the last decade, founding the premiere junking website www.junkmarketstyle.com and appearing on NBC's The Today Show as the junking expert. Whitney has also written three instructional books on the topic.\n\"Integrating junk in your home decor is not confined to flea market decorating,\" says Whitney. \"I love flea market shopping, but there are countless other spots sweet on junk. Salvage yards, used restaurant supply stores and farm sales are just a few of the many alternatives.\"\nThe right products and tools are essential for crafting unique junk projects. Hammers, nails and super glue are good essentials to start with, but if you don't have those handy, you can always find them at thrift stores, yard sales and garage sales.\nWhitney suggests starting with a simple project, such as painting an old coffee table. Once you get the hang of it, you can branch out to more complex projects, such as turning an old dresser into a bedside table. You can even turn an old bookcase into a sideboard.\nOnce you've got the basics down, you can move on to more ambitious projects. For example, you could transform an old dining room table into a barstool. Or you could turn an old couch into a chaise lounge.\nIf you're interested in learning more about how to incorporate junk in your home decor, visit www.junkmarketstyle.com.\nCopyright 2021 ARA News Network.

The 75-pound structure contains approximately 15,000 inches of hosiery, mostly using the waistband due to its durability and flexibility. An armature supports the sculpture; it was made to resemble the circular knitting machines Soucie used during the creation process. Staff at HCMA helped construct a web of energy-efficient LED lights that illuminate the hosiery as it moves through the space.\nThe installation is meant to be viewed from all angles, but the best way to experience it is to walk around it. To do so, you will need to enter through the front door, which is located on the right side of the building. From there, you can head up the stairs to the second floor, where you will find a staircase leading to the third floor.

We already started to reform before the Agreement came into force.\nThe Agreement is highly ambitious and resembles the plans that Eastern European countries adopted before entering the EU. A complex agreement such as this depends on all actors in Ukraine who initiated this momentous change, as well as civil society, to succeed.\nBut we are aware that our efforts alone are not sufficient, but we need the EU\u2019s technical and economic support to ensure that all these changes are actually implemented on schedule.\nUkraine\u2019s current government has achieved visa-free travel to the EU for your citizens.

        "The word one must avoid is \"timeless.\" \"Timeless\" brings bad luck. Nothing tempts the gods so much as the arrogance of a timeless skyscraper.\nAnd yet, no one minds arrogance these days, and a bit of hubris never hurt anyone; even a lot of it--to quote Michael Douglas in his role as greedy arbitrageur--can be a good thing! The greed of big business and the arrogance of big builders have given us vistas and sky views that rival anything from Mount Olympus. Skyscrapers, after all, are about business the way Manhattan is about buildings.\nThe sense of danger and awe that any large structure automatically invokes to those of us who are superstitious but not afraid of heights may never have crossed the architect's mind.\nYou can criticize skyscrapers for their irreverent arrogance, but you can't accuse them of defying the odds. This, after all, is what skyscrapers are supposed to do; this is what they have in common with the man who threw a cable between both towers of the World Trade Center and then proceeded to walk on it. They defy the odds, look the odds in the face and stick their tongue out, as did another fearless soul, the New York Times photographer Ernie Sisto, when he asked two colleagues to hold him by the legs while he climbed out onto a ledge high on the Empire State Building and, aiming down, got the angle he wanted.\nSisto's daring act was part of an ongoing series of photographs taken over the course of several years. He had been photographing the Empire State Building for more than a decade before he decided to climb up there. His first attempt failed because he couldn't get the angle he wanted. But he kept trying until he finally succeeded.\nSisto didn't just take pictures of the Empire State Building. He also took pictures of the Twin Towers, which were still standing at the time, and of the Chrysler Building, which was being built across the street from the Empire State Building. In each case, Sisto managed to get the angle he needed to capture the momentous events of 9/11.\nSisto's work has been exhibited around the world, including at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

He remains a resident of Sheffield, a city with a rich tradition in electronic music, once home to Warp Records, as well as the Human League, Heaven 17 and Moloko among others. However, when he, Stephen Mallinder and Christopher Watson formed Cabaret Voltaire in 1973, fired up by Eno-era Roxy Music and William Burroughs's cut-up techniques, there was no such tradition at all. \"The only musical tradition then was heavy metal, rubbish cover bands and crooners like Tony Christie.\"\nBy 1989, with Cabaret Voltaire all but petered out, a new future had arrived: rave. Warp Records would be home to a new, bespoke, Meccano-like strain of home-built techno. Early releases by LFO and Tricky Disco set the minimal tone, and then Kirk, in partnership with Richard Parrott, formed Sweet Exorcist, whose definitive CCEP/CCCD was the label's first album release in 1991. Rereleased on its 20th anniversary as RetroActivity, with additional unreleased tracks dredged up from Kirk's archive (\"I say 'archive', it's more a roomful of boxes\"), it's essentially a variation on three different tracks, with elements added and subtracted, the bare workings of breakbeats adorned by samples and loops or simply exposed. Its deconstruction/reconstruction is inspired by the work of the likes of Kraftwerk, David Bowie and John Cage.\nKirk has always been an innovator. In the early 1980s, while still working as a sound engineer, he began experimenting with synthesiser programming. \"It wasn't until I got my first computer that I realised what I could do,\" he says. \"I started writing software, which led me down this rabbit hole of trying to make something that sounded like a human being playing a keyboard.

        "In Lean Times, Creative Bakers Turn To Desperation Pies : The Salt Vinegar pie and green tomato pie don't usually top the list of America's favorite sweets. But in Depression-era America, these and other desperation pies that survive today showed off home cooks' ingenuity.\nSome desperation pies, like green tomato pie, still enjoy niche popularity today.\nImagine yourself as a resourceful farmer during the Great Depression. You'd like to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, like cherries or pecans, are too expensive or not available.\nDesperate times call for desperation pies (or starvation recipes, if you happen to be in Greece).\nAlso known as \"make-do\" pies, desperation pies were made with any ingredients a farm cook had on hand or could scrounge up at a moment's notice. \"[Desperation pie is] a pie that you made when you had nothing left to make it with,\" says food folklorist and author Joanne Raetz Stuttgen.\nAnd sometimes this meant pulling off feats of tastebud trickery that modern day chefs are rediscovering with great interest, Stuttgen tells The Salt.\nFor example, vinegar pie was the creative cook's fruit-free answer to lemon meringue pie. \"If you want a lemon meringue pie but you have no lemons, the vinegar gets the tartness like the lemon,\" says Stuttgen, who has written several books about the history of American cooking.\nAnother popular desperation pie was green tomato pie, which used canned tomatoes instead of fresh ones. \"Canned tomatoes are cheaper and easier to get than fresh tomatoes,\" says Stuttgen. \"They're also more nutritious.\"\nStuttgen points out that desperation pies weren't just limited to fruits and vegetables; they also included breads, crackers, and even meat. \"You can make a lot of different kinds of desperation pies,\" she says. \"It depends on what you've got on hand.\"\nThe Green Tomato Pie: A Recipe For Survival In Depression-Era America was originally published on hellobeautiful.com\nAlso On Majic 102.3 - 92.7:\nClose Thank you for subscribing!

The list is assembled by a panel of experts in archaeology, architecture, art history and preservation in an effort to promote awareness and action.\n\"Some sites are famous, others struggle for recognition,\" said Bonnie Burnham, president of the organization. \"It is our goal to help as many as possible.\n\"For some sites, inclusion in the Watch is the best chance to survive.\"\nThe list cited escalating violence in Syria for the devastating effect on some of its monuments, including the citadel of Aleppo and the fortress of Qa&apos;lat al-Mudique.\nEero Saarinen&apos;s Gateway Arch, a mid-century modern structure, was at risk due to \"encroaching corrosion,\" the result of the challenges its extreme height and design presented for its preservation, the group said.\nOther sites on the list include the Great Mosque of Samarra in Iraq, which suffered damage during the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., which was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nIn addition, the group noted the threat posed by climate change and rising sea levels, as well as urban sprawl, pollution and other threats.\n\"We have to be very careful about what we do with these places,\" Burnham said. \"If we don&apos;t take care of them now, they will be lost forever.\"\nAmong the most notable additions to the list this year were the Egyptian pyramids of Giza and Luxor in Egypt, the Taj Mahal in India, the Great Wall of China and the Great Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt.\nThe list also included the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia.\nThe",
        "WYOMING \u2014 The state Attorney General\u2019s office has requested documents from Wyoming Borough.\nAt a council meeting Monday, borough council unanimously approved allowing solicitor Lars Anderson and manager Roseanne Colarusso to cooperate with the attorney general\u2019s office for records they requested and any future records they may request.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019ve just asked for documents,\u201d Anderson said.\nCouncil also heard from Mike Lombardo, vice president of the Greater Pittston Regional Ambulance Association.\nMayor Joseph Dominick invited members of the ambulance association to the meeting after residents asked him why ambulances from that association and West Wyoming sometimes responded to calls.\nThat sometimes happens because the Greater Pittston Regional Ambulance Association provides advanced life support services to the borough, which are emergency services for more serious calls such as a heart attack or stroke.\nSome calls require an ALS ambulance to respond along with a BLS ambulance, which is why people may see the two vehicles on scene, Lombardo said.\nGreater Pittston also provides basic life support services when the borough\u2019s normal BLS ambulance, which comes from West Wyoming, is unavailable, so that is another reason people may see their ambulances in the borough.\nSome residents pay for a subscription to West Wyoming ambulance service, said councilwoman Diane Smiles.\nDominick said council should look into whether Greater Pittston ambulances should be allowed to respond to calls in the borough.\n\u201cI think it would be a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019ve ever thought about before, but I think it would be a good idea.\u201d\nSmiles said she was concerned about the cost of having ambulances respond to calls in the borough.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much it costs to have an ambulance come out here,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s covered by insurance or not.\u201d\nLombardo said there is no cost associated with responding to calls in the borough.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all volunteer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no money involved. It\u2019s all volunteers.\u201d\nSmiles said she didn\u2019t want to discourage anyone from calling 911 if they need help.\n\ufffd",
        "DYESS, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Money and memorabilia from Johnny Cash's family and friends have helped historians restore a significant part of the Historic Dyess Colony, a government collective built to pull Depression-era families out of poverty.\nThe country music icon's boyhood home, along with the colony's former headquarters, will open Saturday to reflect everyday life in a northeast Arkansas community built on once-sunken land.\n\"Restoring the Dyess Colony Administration Building, and even saving at least one of the typical colony houses, would have been a worthwhile project, even without the Johnny Cash connection,\" said Ruth Hawkins, the executive director of the Heritage Sites program at Arkansas State University.\nBefore he was the Man in Black, he was J.R. Cash, a son of Kingsland, Arkansas, farmers who successfully applied to take part in a 1930s Works Progress Administration experiment. The federal government brought in 487 families and gave them land and a mule.\n\"This was a practice in socialism,\" said Roscoe Phillips, who was born at Dyess 77 years ago. \"They took people who had nothing and gave us something. It wouldn't happen today.\"\nA restored five-room house northwest of town holds items that belonged to the singer's parents \u2014 a shaving mug in the bathroom and an upright piano atop red linoleum in the living room. J.R. shared a bedroom at the front of the house with three siblings. His mother worked as a seamstress and his father drove a truck for the state highway department.\n\"We were poor, but we didn't know it,\" Phillips said. \"It wasn't until I got older that I realized how bad we were off.\"\nThe money they received from the WPA allowed them to build their own homes, including a two-story log cabin where J.R. grew up. He later moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career as a songwriter and record producer. He died in 2003 at age 67.\nThe Dyess Colony is now owned by the National Park Service, which has spent more than $1 million restoring the property over the past decade. The agency hopes to attract visitors this weekend, especially those interested in learning about the early days of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program.\n\"I think there are a lot of people who don't know much about the history of the Dyess Colony, so this",
        "In a democracy, it is said, we get the government we deserve. The same can be said of bestselling guru prescriptives.\nMalcolm Gladwell's new book What the Dog Saw, a compilation of some of his favorite New Yorker pieces, has drawn both praise and criticism. Personally, I'm not a big Gladwell fan. Shoot me. I'm told he's an interesting person. And he knows how to tell a good anecdote. But, at the risk of oversimplifying my critique of his work... he oversimplifies.\nThe general thesis of Blink, for example, was \"trust your gut... except when you shouldn't.\" Okay... but why can you trust your gut sometimes, but not others? What does that tell us about what \"gut\" instinct really is? And what does that mean in terms of how we process information in the world? And what do we do with that knowledge? The really interesting points are left dangling. Why? I don't know, but I suspect it's because they're complex and not easily summarized... and might muddy the simple and easily-grasped ideas or conclusions that are a trademark of Gladwell's work.\nIf I'm not a fan of Gladwell, it's because I want to see robust logic behind an argument, depth to its exploration, and acknowledgment of the complexities and contradictions it may entail. Simple, neat answers don't appeal to me, because they don't resonate with what I've learned about myself and the world around me.\nGladwell doesn't offer any of those things here. Instead, he offers up a series of anecdotes (some true, some false) that seem to have been pulled out of thin air by someone who has no idea what he's talking about. In other words, this isn't a well-researched, thought-provoking piece of writing. It's just a bunch of random facts and anecdotes.\nI'll give him credit for one thing: He's not afraid to admit that he doesn't know everything there is to know about the world. That's refreshing.\nBut if you're going to write a book like Blink, you should at least try to make sure you know what you're talking about before you start telling people how to live their lives.\nRead more from Michael Hiltzik\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

        "Sports|FIFA\u2019s Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It.\nFIFA\u2019s Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It.\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino\u2019s plans to reorder world soccer are being stymied by a familiar foe: Europe.\nSince proposing several major changes to the sport\u2019s calendar last spring, Infantino has spent months traveling the world hosting minisummits with the leaders of FIFA\u2019s 211 member federations. His goal is to win support for a proposal to introduce two new tournaments \u2014 an expanded World Cup for clubs and a new league for national teams \u2014 that would be underwritten by a $25 billion offer from a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.\nThe listening exercise follows repeated failures by Infantino to force the proposals through FIFA\u2019s governing council, but if they are approved they would represent the biggest changes to soccer in a generation, and their adoption \u2014 and the multibillion-dollar cash infusion to FIFA \u2014 would provide Infantino with a signature success ahead of his bid to secure a second term as FIFA president later this year.\nEach of the meetings on Infantino\u2019s tour, including the most recent one held in Marrakesh, Morocco, has included about 50 federation leaders from across soccer\u2019s six regional confederations. At the same time, European soccer officials have been working behind the scenes to block the reforms, which they fear could lead to the loss of lucrative television rights deals and jeopardize the long-term viability of the Champions League and Europa League.\nInfantino, who was elected FIFA president in February 2016, has made no secret of his desire to reshape the global game. He wants to increase the number of games played each year, reduce the gap between the top leagues and lower divisions, and create a more competitive international schedule.\nHe has also proposed expanding the World Cup from 32 teams to 48, adding a third qualifying round for the 2022 tournament in Qatar, and creating a new club competition called the Club World Cup to replace the current Champions League and Europa League.\nInfantino has said he will present his plan to FIFA\u2019s executive committee at its next meeting in June. But it remains unclear how much support he will receive, or whether he will be able to push through the changes",
        "Australia's top order have crumbled with the bat yet again, relinquishing the ascendancy at Adelaide Oval with the hosts scrapping to 4-117 at tea on day two of the first Test against India. The opener tried to hit the big drive but got the inside edge back onto the stumps. Marcus Harris nearly caught it, with the ball barely crossing over the ropes and the umpire took some time to call it a six. Australia run-rate has been on slower side as they trail by 100 runs now. India bowled exceptionally well.\nThe decision to drop Marsh leaves Australia without a fifth bowling option and gives Indian coach Ravi Shastri an obvious first line in his final team address. The hosts will be looking to get close to India's total.\nRun-scoring hasn't been easy but Australia have played in a circumspect manner as well.\nIndia will be hoping that Shami and Bumrah score some 20 more runs. At stumps, Mohammed Shami was on six. However, he pushed one forward against Ashwin and gloved it to keeper Rishabh Pant. Harris, Marsh and Khawaja were all deceived for length by Ashwin's flight and drift, getting trapped into a guessing game as to how much the ball would spin and bounce. Post tea, Pujara added 62 runs with R Ashwin (25) for the seventh wicket. Whereas in the UAE against Pakistan, he was able to find the boundary with regularity.\nPujara is playing his first Test match after recovering from a shoulder injury sustained during the tour of South Africa last year. He had also missed the second Test against New Zealand earlier this month due to the same injury.\nAshwin, who scored a half century in the first innings, was dismissed by Pat Cummins off the very next ball when he edged a short delivery straight to Tim Paine at third slip.\nBrief scores: India 1st innings 4117/9d; Australia 2nd innings 4117/9d.\nCatch up on all the latest sports news and updates here.

        "Aaron Sorkin's newsroom drama More As This Story Develops is closing in on its female cast - as Marisa Tomei has been pegged for the female lead and Olivia Munn as well as Alison Pill are negotiating for supporting roles.\nMore As This Story Develops is the working title for Sorkin's latest project, now in the pilot stage at HBO. It follows cable news anchor Will McCallister (Jeff Daniels, State of Play) and his production team as they report and interpret the news on his show.\nMarisa Tomei is being pursued for the female lead, in the role of the news show's executive producer Mackenzie. While Tomei isn't in active negotiations like the other two women mentioned, she's considered the front-runner for the part. Oscar-winner Tomei's recent projects include Darren Aronofsky drama The Wrestler in 2008 and The Lincoln Lawyer.\nOlivia Munn is slated to play a young financial analyst with her own show on the same fictional cable network. She's currently in negotiations to take the part - after turning down numerous other pilots this season. Munn gained notoriety as a talk show hostess on cable gaming channel G4, before scoring a recurring \"correspondent\" role on The Daily Show - and later a lead in NBC's short-lived comedy Perfect Couples.\nAlison Pill's role is Maggie, a young associate producer on the news show. While only 25, Pill is already an established actress, having appeared in films such as X-Men: First Class and The Fighter. Her most recent TV credits include CBS' CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and ABC's Grey's Anatomy.\nHBO has yet to announce any casting decisions for the series, which will be produced by Sorkin's company Sorkin & Sorkin Productions.

        "In 1996, McCall magazine published a \u201cHow do you relieve stress?\u201d column highlighting how different people relaxed. As one of those interviewed, I described how watching my three dogs interact was soothing to me.\nNot only did my dogs help me relax, but also their unique way of interacting, sharing the spotlight and taking or following the lead, taught me much about how to successfully interact with people in my own life. At the time, I was running special programs for Montefiore Medical Center and private practices in Irvington and Chappaqua, New York. I instinctively knew the dogs\u2019 teachings were of significant help to me even though the health benefits of having pets were not common knowledge or fodder for research back then.\nFifteen years later, science has caught up with what so many of us instinctively knew: Pets help improve our health.\nToday, as I get ready to write my fifth book, still see patients in two offices four days a week, write articles, participate in media events, and even train physicians, the one thing that has kept me grounded and given me the proper perspective on my hectic life is always my dogs.\nWhile the wonderful dogs I had in 1996 are no longer here, a new generation of brilliant, loyal, loving, and funny dachshunds keeps me in line and teaches me how to be a better person. My health, which thankfully, is great because I follow my own advice and take supplements and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT), would have been far worse if it weren\u2019t for the unconditional love and companionship I received from these amazing animals.\nI am grateful to all the veterinarians, animal behaviorists, and dog trainers who have helped me over the years. I am especially grateful to Dr. Michael J. O\u2019Brien at Montefiore Animal Hospital in West Nyack, N.Y., who first introduced me to Doberman Pinschers when I was just starting out in veterinary medicine. He was kind enough to share his expertise with me and gave me the tools I needed to become the best veterinarian I could be.\nDr. O\u2019Brien is now retired, but he continues to be an invaluable source of information and guidance. In fact, he recently wrote an article for The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) titled \u201cDogs Can Help You Live Longer and Healthier.\u201d It is a must-",
        "How did Quark manage to get the massive market share that it has of the publishing world? Was it the typographical precision?\nBecause we have the best product. Quark has 90 per cent of the share in publishing and that\u2019s reasonable (laugh). Reliability, ease of use and a very strong architecture so that it is flexible and can be changed, and the extensions. I have people coming to me and saying that when they use the competitor\u2019s products, they spend double the time. And time is quite valuable.\nI think that it is because we have spent tremendous amount of time and energy trying to understand what makes a customer happy when he uses it. You are correct also that we have tremendous precision. We supported very strong typographical features way earlier than anybody else. It is not just the features, it feels better.\nHow did you all come up with the idea of having something like Quark?\nThe company was started by a partner of mine (Tim Gill, see box), who is no longer a shareholder He came from the computer side and I came from the computer and publishing background. When we got involved, both of us wanted to democratise publishing. In those days, because of the expensive cost of pre-press processes, very few people could publish. It took millions of dollars to start a publication.\nWe thought that it would be a good contribution to the world if we provided tools so that people with modest means could publish their own books. So we set out to do that. The first version of Quark was called \u201cQuarkXPress\u201d. It was an open source project. We had a lot of help from the community. There were a lot of people who contributed to the project.\nWhen we launched the second version, it became clear that there was a need for a more professional version of Quark. So we decided to make it a commercial product. That\u2019s how QuarkXPress 2.0 came into being.\nWhat made you decide to go commercial?\nThere were two main reasons. First, we realised that there was a huge gap between what publishers needed and what they could afford. Second, we realised that there was a huge demand for our product. Publishers were looking for ways to reduce costs. They were looking for ways to increase productivity. They were looking for ways to improve the quality of their publications. They were looking for ways to make them more attractive",
        "Analysts predict that Apple alone could sell 28 million iPad tablets in 2011. That doesn't even take the Samsung Galaxy Tab, or the rest of the upcoming tablets expected in the next few months into consideration, and doesn't bode well for other mobile computing platforms. The netbook in particular will be the primary victim of the rise of the tablet, and will quickly be rendered obsolete.\nThe primary advantages of a netbook--when compared with larger notebook computers--are size, weight, and battery life. Netbooks are more diminutive and manage to squeeze the guts of the computer into a case generally smaller than a sheet of paper and not much thicker than a standard paperback novel when closed.\nWith the smaller physical dimensions comes a significantly lower weight as well. The average weight of netbooks ranges from two to four pounds, or about half the weight of many notebook computers. A handicap of the netbook is that it lacks an internal DVD drive in order to make the smaller case and lighter weight possible.\nOne of the biggest advantages of a netbook, though, is the extended battery life. While notebooks may last only a couple hours on a fully-charged battery, a netbook can typically make it through a full business day on a single charge.\nHowever, the biggest draw of netbooks is arguably price. With prices starting in the $200 range, and netbooks available from wireless carriers with subsidized pricing as low as $50 in exchange for a commitment to a data plan, the netbook has become a viable option for consumers who want to get their work done without having to lug around a heavy laptop.\nNetbooks have also been a boon to small businesses, allowing them to cut down on the number of employees they need to hire. Smaller companies can now afford to buy a netbook for each employee, which allows them to save money while still being able to provide the same level of service to their customers.\nIn addition to the netbook's advantages, there are some drawbacks. For one thing, the lack of a built-in hard drive makes it difficult to store large amounts of data, especially if you're planning to use the netbook for any kind of serious work.\nAnother drawback is the fact that most netbooks run Windows XP. This operating system is no longer supported by major hardware manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Dell (DELL). As a result, many users find themselves stuck using older versions of",

        "Baby names can't be stolen, but it's not surprising that some parents think they can.\nHaving the same name will not scar these children for life.\nMy daughter\u2019s name was very special to me. I had chosen the name for my daughter a long time before I had even conceived her because I had seen it in a special book, and I loved it instantly. I chose this name because it was a very unusual Jewish name (at the time), and I knew no one else would have it (later it became very popular).\nMy heart sank. Why would she do this? There are so many names to choose from, so why would she choose my special name? And if she wanted my name, why wouldn\u2019t she at least ask me if it was OK\u2014out of respect?\nWoolsey waited a month and then wrote an email to Jessica in which she explained her feelings of disappointment. Jessica responded \u201chatefully.\u201d It\u2019s been three years, and they haven\u2019t spoken since.\nThis belief is ridiculous\u2014after all, liking a name doesn\u2019t give you ownership over it, and sharing a name with a friend or relative is, at worst, a mild nuisance. But the idea that names shouldn\u2019t be stolen is not surprising. Over the past hundred years, naming has increasingly become an act of self-expression for parents, a way to assert their individuality rather than a sense of belonging to a larger community.\nIn the United States alone, there are more than two million baby names registered each year, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women\u2019s Health. That number is expected to double by 2040. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents register their child\u2019s name with the Social Security Administration as soon as possible after birth.\nBut what happens when parents don\u2019t follow this advice? What happens when they decide to share a name with someone who isn\u2019t related to them? The answer is simple: They get sued.\nAccording to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), about 1,000 lawsuits were filed against people who shared a name with another person between 2000 and 2015. Most of those cases involved people who shared a name with a spouse or partner, but there were also cases involving siblings, parents, grandparents, and other close family members.\n",
        "In a dramatic twist on last season\u2019s national championship game, Jalen Hurts came off the bench to pass for one touchdown and run for another in the fourth quarter, rallying No. 1 Alabama to a 35-28 win over No. 4 Georgia for the Southeastern Conference title Saturday.\nHeisman Trophy favorite Tua Tagovailoa had to be helped off the field with just over 11 minutes remaining after one of his own linemen stepped on the quarterback's right ankle as he attempted to throw.\nEnter Hurts, who led Alabama to the national title game as a freshman but lost the starting job to Tagovailoa. Hurts calmly guided the No. 1 Crimson Tide (13-0) to a game-tying touchdown with a 10-yard pass to Jerry Jeudy, capping a 16-play, 80-yard drive that consumed more than 7 minutes.\nAfter No. 4 Georgia (11-2) was stuffed on a fake punt near midfield, Hurts took matters into his own hands for the winning score. Spotting an opening up the middle, he took off on a 15-yard TD run with 1:04 remaining.\nThis was a reversal of the storyline from last season's national title game, when Tagovailoa replaced an ineffective Hurts at the start of the second half with Alabama trailing Georgia 13-0. The replacement threw three touchdown passes, including a 41-yarder in overtime that gave the Tide a 28-23 victory.\nTagovailoa finished 23 of 36 for 295 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for a score.\nThe Bulldogs were without star running back D'Andre Swift, who was suspended indefinitely by coach Kirby Smart for violating team rules.\nHurts completed 14 of 21 passes for 188 yards and a touchdown before being taken out late in the fourth quarter. He was sacked twice and fumbled once.\n\"I'm not going to sugarcoat it,\" Saban said. \"We didn't play well enough to win this game.\"\nGeorgia's Jake Fromm completed 24 of 37 passes for 270 yards and two scores.\nAlabama's defense held the Bulldogs to just 3 of 12 on third down and forced four turnovers, including two interceptions by Minkah Fitzpatrick.\nFitzpatrick returned the first pick 55 yards for a touchdown, then picked off Fromm on the ensuing possession.\n\"It was a great feeling,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I've been",
        "I became a mother before I fully grew into my own skin. I was nearly 17 years old when I had my first baby, and everyone was wearing crop tops that year. Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera displayed their taut midriffs in hit music videos. The poster for \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d featured a single red rose over a smooth, flawless belly. Friends would complain about their slightly protruding bellies; they thought they were fat. Me, I had a mom belly. Clearly plump. Zero definition. Stretch marks ran along my sides, deep and dark, altering the color and texture of my skin forever.

        "After an Iranian official said that the Islamic Republic's athletes would play \u201cevery country\u201d at the Olympics, it seemed the London Games would put a halt to Iranians boycotting events to avoid facing off against Israelis.\nBut the question of whether Iran and Israel will compete head to head is up in the air again after an Iranian news agency linked to the government reported that the official had been misquoted earlier this week.\nDucking out of events to make a statement is frowned on by the Olympics. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, warned earlier this summer that athletes who bowed out of competition without a good reason would face sanctions.\nBahram Afsharzadeh, secretary-general of the Iranian Olympic committee, seemed to swear off any boycott in his remarks. \u201cWe just follow the sportsmanship and play every country,\u201d Afsharzadeh was quoted as saying by the Associated Press and other outlets Monday.\nThe Associated Press noted that at times, Afsharzadeh had been speaking through an interpreter. In Iran, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported Tuesday that his words had been twisted, saying that Afsharzadeh had never named Israel in his remarks.\nThe debate may be a purely symbolic one: Iranian athletes are unlikely to face Israelis in competition at all, with the two countries sending few Olympians in the same categories, according to Israeli media.\nAn Iranian athlete has won a gold medal in judo in each of the last three Olympics, but there have been no Israeli competitors since 2004.\nIranian officials say they want to show their support for the Palestinian people during the games, which begin July 27 and end Aug. 12.\nCopyright 2021 NPR.

        "Government agencies are seeking broad new authority to ramp up killings and removals of gray wolves in the Northern Rockies and Great Lakes, despite two recent court actions that restored the animal's endangered status in every state except Alaska and Minnesota.\nVarious proposals would gas pups in their dens, surgically sterilize adult wolves and allow \"conservation\" or \"research\" hunts to drive down the predators' numbers.\nOnce poisoned to near-extermination in the lower 48 states, wolves made a remarkable comeback over the last two decades under protection of the Endangered Species Act. But as packs continue to multiply their taste for livestock and big game herds coveted by hunters has stoked a rising backlash.\nWildlife officials say that without public wolf hunting, they need greater latitude to eliminate problem packs. Montana and Idaho held inaugural hunts last year but an August court ruling scuttled their plans for 2010.\n\"As the wolf populations increase, the depredations increase and the number of wolf removals will increase. It's very logical,\" said Mark Collinge, Idaho director for Wildlife Services, the U.S. Department of Agriculture branch that removes problem wolves, typically by shooting them from aircraft.\n\"You just have to accept that part of having wolves is having to kill wolves,\" he said.\nBut wildlife advocates and animal rights groups contend the response to depredating wolves has become too heavy-handed. They say a string of court decisions in their favor underscores that the species remains at risk of extinction.\n\"We're not going to be able to save wolves if we don't do something about the depredation of wolves,\" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, which filed suit against the federal government in June on behalf of three wolves killed in Idaho.\nThe center says it has documented more than 1,000 cases of wolves being shot, poisoned or otherwise harmed since 1990.\n\"It's like trying to fix a leaky faucet with a sledgehammer,\" Brune said.\nWOLVES ON THE RISE\nA decade ago, there were fewer than 2,500 wolves in the contiguous United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Today, there are more than 6,000.\nThat growth has been driven largely by the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park in 1995. The park's population now stands at nearly 3,000, making it one of the most successful",
        "Principal of Candido Consulting Group, focused on helping businesses achieve optimal employee performance.\nIt\u2019s no secret that the annual review stirs anxiety among employees as well as their managers, who usually dread its tediousness and potential for confrontation. Yet despite being widely documented as ineffective and demotivating, the annual review remains a continued practice with changes over the years made only to the format and tone.\nWhat it really needs is an actual overhaul.\nToday\u2019s reality is that, for the first time in history, any given company may have multiple generations working alongside each other, with millennials influencing as much change on policy and procedures as their boomer predecessors did.\nThese differences bring their own challenges, especially when older workers may find themselves reporting to someone younger. In addition, the increased pace of modern business has led to new and rapidly changing roles, making the traditional annual review an antiquated exercise, at best.\nThanks to the digital age we have all come to expect instant responses. And having grown up in an era of \u201cinstant gratification\u201d from social media, instant messaging and text, millennials and their younger counterparts are especially more likely than older workers to require constant feedback and more frequent check-ins.\nWhile managers have long been encouraged to provide regular feedback and periodic check-ins, what actually makes feedback meaningful is when it\u2019s given in a timely manner. Employees benefit more from in-the-moment praise for a successful achievement or constructive criticism for a less-than-stellar effort.\nIn fact, according to research conducted by Harvard Business School professor Robert Cialdini and his co-authors, those who receive feedback regularly report higher levels of job satisfaction, lower levels of stress and greater job satisfaction overall than those who don\u2019t.\nSo how do you make sure your employees feel heard and valued? Here are some tips:\n1. Set clear expectations.\nOne of the most important things you can do to help your employees feel heard and valued is to set clear expectations about what they need to accomplish in order to be considered for promotion or advancement.\nFor example, if you\u2019re looking to hire a new salesperson, you might say something like this: \u201cI want you to sell $100,000 worth of products in the next six months. If you meet that goal, I will give you a raise. If not, I will keep you where you are.\u201d",

Rep. Anderson is a member of the Texas House of Representatives representing District 106, which includes Grand Prairie, Irving, and part of Dallas. Rep. Anderson is a freshman in the House of Representatives. We had a good conversation where he shared with me why he decided to get involved in politics.\nDistrict 106 is composed of a majority of minorities. Rep. Anderson explained how he spent 6 months getting to know the community, knocking on over 15,000 doors during his campaign. The people of his district are concerned about three issues: jobs, illegal immigration and taxes.\nRep. Anderson explained why he joined the Hispanic Republican Conference and also his participation in two House Committees, Economic and Small Business Development and Land and Resource Management.\nAdryana Boyne: We're glad to be here with Representative Rodney Anderson from the Dallas area.

In 2012, I ran for re-election and won the general election.\nAdryana Boyne: What do you think is the most important issue facing our country right now?\nRodney Anderson: The most important",
        "Who Was in Kiev\u2019s Independence Square?\nNow that Viktor Yanukovych has gone, and new elections are promised, we need to assess the political and popular forces that succeeded in overturning Ukraine\u2019s political system. Who were the protesters and what were their goals? At the barricades in central Kiev there were Ukrainian and EU flags, as well as portraits of the poet Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), considered as a spiritual father of Ukrainian identity, and of Stepan Bandera (1909-1959) who was, depending on your point of view, either a great patriot or a Nazi collaborator. And there were pictures of five Ukrainian activists, treated as martyrs after they were killed during the clashes in Grushevsky Street.\nMaidan Nezalezhnosti, Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, the epicentre of the protests that had been taking place across Ukraine for three months, was filled with tents pitched by sympathisers from every part of the country: from Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk, the strongholds of nationalism, but also from Lugansk and Donetsk, the big cities of the industrial east, which have always felt close to Russia. Cossacks wore their traditional costume. Women brought black bread and ham to the men standing guard. There was a pervasive smell of tea, cabbage soup and wood fires. During the week, the few thousand activists went about their daily lives, going to work, buying groceries, visiting friends and relatives. On weekends, the crowds swelled to more than 100,000 people.\nThe Maidan was not just a protest site; it was an open-air museum, where visitors could learn about the history of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. It was also a centre of resistance against the authorities. In the early hours of the morning, when the police tried to break up the demonstration, the demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails at them. The police retaliated with tear gas and rubber bullets, killing dozens of people.\nOn February 22nd, the day before the presidential election, thousands of people gathered in front of the parliament building in Kiev. They chanted \u201cWe want to be free!\u201d and \u201cYanukovych is a thief!\u201d Some carried placards with slogans such as \u201cCrimea is our land!\u201d and \u201cUkraine belongs to Ukrainians!\u201d\nIn",
        "From the mountains of Kashmir to the forests of central India and the troubled towns of its remote northeast, troops are on the streets in a major security crackdown ahead of Independence Day celebrations.\nIndia celebrates the 60th anniversary of independence from British rule on Wednesday, a day traditionally marked by violent attacks by separatists or Maoist rebels, and security forces are on their highest level of alert in many areas.\nIn New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will unfurl the national flag from the ramparts of the historic Red Fort on Wednesday morning to a 21-gun salute, and then address the nation in a speech expected to laud six decades of progress.\nBut about 1,400 km (900 miles) away in the remote northeast, separatists in the oil- and tea-rich state of Assam have already killed 30 people since Wednesday, including women and children, all of them Hindi-speaking settlers.\nThe army has intensified patrols and aerial surveillance of Assam's hills and forests, while armed police have mounted roadblocks outside the major towns and even conducted house-to-house searches in some areas.\nPolice say more attacks are planned, with reports guerrillas have sneaked into Assam's main city Guwahati and other towns from hideouts in neighboring Bangladesh and Myanmar.\n\"We have enough intelligence inputs suggesting the militants are out to create trouble before and on August 15,\" a senior police officer said on condition of anonymity.\n\"They might also target prominent places such as railway stations, bus depots and airports.\"\nAssam's chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, told reporters on Tuesday that his government was ready for any eventuality.\n\"If there is an attack, we will be able to deal with it,\" he said. \"I am confident that the situation will remain under control.\"\nA spokesman for the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), which has been waging a three-decade insurgency against the Indian state, said the group had no plans to carry out any violence.\n\"We don't want to disturb the peace and tranquillity of Assam,\" said Pradip Bhanu Mehta, who heads the ULFA's media wing. \"We are not going to do anything untoward.

Since the very early days we\u2019ve used market feedback and usage metrics to evolve our product. Change is incremental rather than at a frenetic pace but it\u2019s a component that\u2019s absolutely critical for a company\u2019s survival in the early days and for growth from there.\nDo you have investors?

The website for the electricity utility in New Orleans, Etergy, showed that more than 15,000 customers had lost power.\nNew Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu told The Associated Press that dozens of people reportedly suffered minor injuries, and a spokesman for the city's Emergency Medical Services described those injured as \"walking wounded.\"\nEshon Trosclair holds her son Camron Chapital on Tuesday after a tornado tore through while they were inside their home in the eastern part of New Orleans.

        "Chance, in the course of a verse, a song, or an album, always seems to be stretching toward something new, something else.\nThe third mixtape by Chance the Rapper, \u201cColoring Book,\u201d begins with the sound of a trumpet. Soon subtly harmonized, the horn (played by Chance\u2019s constant sideman and alter-ego, Donnie Trumpet) teeters between controlled and offhanded play, tumbling almost accidentally into short, congested melismas. The impression is of an excited warmup, less an announcement than the happy hurry that precedes one. In this way, the trumpet is a kind of synecdoche for Chance\u2019s ramplike gift: in the course of a verse, a song, or, here, the ecstatic whole of an album, he always seems to be stretching toward something new, something else. Chance is a funny, earnest, off-kilter lyricist, but his real power\u2014this ability to always be building\u2014rises from a level far beneath text. \u201cColoring Book\u201d is, above all, a showcase for its creator\u2019s preternatural understanding of the elements that make up a mood.\n\u201cAll We Got,\u201d the horn-led first song of \u201cColoring Book,\u201d feels like a sequel to \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d and not only because it is another collaboration with West, who co-produced both songs. It also feels like a return to form for Chance, whose last two mixtapes, 2013\u2019s Coloring Book and 2014\u2019s Acid Rap, were so much more experimental than anything he\u2019d done before them. On \u201cAll We Got,\u201d Chance raps over a looping bassline that sounds as if it could have come straight out of Kanye\u2019s 808s & Heartbreak; on \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d Chance rapped over a looping bassline that sounded as if it came straight out of Jay-Z\u2019s 4:44. This time around, though, Chance has gone back to basics. He doesn\u2019t use any loops at all. Instead, he uses a single drum machine, which he plays himself, and a few synthesizers. The result is a stripped-down version of Chance\u2019s signature style, one in which every syllable is",
        "Demonstrators in Polish cities have raised an outcry over judicial reforms amid a toxic media campaign.\nThe largest protests were in Warsaw, where 10,000 people, according to city authorities, assembled outside parliament and outside the supreme court on Sunday (16 July).\nThousands of people also assembled in other cities, including Katowice, Krakow, Lodz, Opole, Poznan, Szczecin, Torun, and Wroclaw.\nPeople lit candles around court buildings in what they called a \u201cChain of Light\u201d.\nThey also carried signs and chanted slogans which accused the ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), and its leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, of turning Poland into a \u201cdictatorship\u201d.\nThe demonstrations came after PiS extended its control over Poland\u2019s judiciary by passing two bills in the senate on Friday.\nThe first one lets the government pick 15 out of 22 judges on the National Council of the Judiciary, which supervises judicial ethics. The second one lets it appoint district and appeals court judges.\nThe laws still have to be signed by Polish president Andrzej Duda, but he is loyal to Kaczynski.\nA third bill, to be debated in parliament on Tuesday, would also let PiS appoint supreme court judges.\nPoland was already under European Commission scrutiny after the Kaczynski government installed loyalists in the country\u2019s constitutional court.\nCritics say the changes are aimed at curtailing the independence of the courts and making it harder for judges to rule against PiS-backed legislation.\nThe EU has threatened to impose sanctions on Poland if it goes ahead with the reforms.\nIn response, PiS has said it will not back down from its plans.\nOn Saturday (15 July), PiS supporters held a rally in front of the Supreme Court in Warsaw, chanting: \u201cWe won\u2019t give up! We won\u2019t give up!\u201d\n\u201cI am here because I believe that we must defend our democracy,\u201d said one demonstrator who gave his name only as Pawe\u0142.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my children or grandchildren to live in a country where there is no freedom of speech,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\nAnother demonstrator, Janusz Piotrowski, said he had come to the protest to show solidarity",
        "A rusty gun which is believed to have been used by legendary artist Vincent Van Gogh to kill himself is to be sold at auction for the first time.\nOn July 27 1890 the Dutch painter was shot in the stomach in northern France and he died two days later.\nIt is thought he was shot by himself or by an unknown enemy.\nThe 7mm Lefaucheux revolver was found 75 years later in a field near the village of Auvers-sur-Oise where the artist was staying - and investigators believe it was the weapon used to shoot him.\nDrouot, the Paris auction house, are organising the sale in June and have estimated the rusting weapon's price at as up to around \u00a350,000.\nForensics investigators have proved the gun dates back to the 1890s and have described it as the'most infamous gun in the history of art' - because Van Gogh was only 37 at the time, and could have carried on painting for years.\nIt also explained in the statement that the gun was a 'low power' weapon, possibly explaining why Van Gogh did not die instantly.\nThe revolver going under the hammer in Paris was part of a 2016 exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam but this is the first time it's going under the hammer.\nThere were no witnesses to the tragedy, which took place in a wheat field or a barn in the French village of Auvers-sur-Oise, about 60 miles north of Paris.\nVan Gogh had been living with his brother Theo in Auvers-sur-Oise when he was killed.\nHis body was never found.\nHe was known to have suffered from mental health problems, including paranoid schizophrenia and depression.\nIn a letter written just before his death, he wrote: 'I don't know if I will ever paint again.\n'If I do, it will be after I am dead.'\nThe auction house said the gun has been examined by forensic experts who have confirmed its date of manufacture and provenance.\nForensic expert Jean-Francois Drouot told AFP news agency: 'We can say with certainty that the gun was used by Van Gogh.\n'This is the most famous gun in the history of art. It is the most infamous gun in the history of art because Van Gogh was only 37 at the time, and could have carried on painting for years.'\nHe added",
        "When you're enjoying your extra hour in bed Sunday morning, spare a thought for what that 60 minutes might cost.\nWhile some dislike the seasonal shifts of Daylight Saving Time (DST) for the minor inconvenience to their sleep cycles and busy schedules, there's a more serious side to the scheme: the loss of an hour of afternoon sunlight when it ends\u2014as it does this weekend\u2014may increase the likelihood of traffic accidents.\n\"Darkness kills and sunlight saves lives,\" said University of Washington Law Professor Steve Calandrillo, who has studied the effectiveness of different DST policies. \"The question is 'when do you want sunlight?'\"\nFor Calandrillo, who advocates for DST to be implemented throughout the year, the answer is simple: more people are active during the evening, including kids, and the additional sunlight that DST provides helps provide drivers with the visibility necessary to see pedestrians. \"At 5 pm virtually everyone in society is awake,\" he said. \"There are far more people asleep at 7 in the morning than at 7 in the evening.\"\nIn addition to leading to poor visibility in darkness, some experts say the requirement for people to abruptly adapt to a time change overnight may lead to dangerous driving. \"Even though it\u2019s dark, you\u2019re still behaving like it\u2019s light,\" said Lawrence University economist David Gerard, of the first weeks after a time change. People may drive faster, he said, and pedestrians may be less attentive because they don't know how long it will take them to get from one place to another.\nA study published last month in the Journal of Traffic Safety found that DST increases the risk of fatal crashes by as much as 10 percent. The researchers analyzed data from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (NHTSA-FARS), which collects information on traffic fatalities over a five-year period. They found that DST was associated with an 11 percent increase in the number of deaths caused by motor vehicle crashes, compared to the same period in the previous year.\nCalandrillo said that while the NHTSA-FARS data doesn\u2019t show a direct relationship between daylight saving time and traffic fatalities, it does suggest that DST can have a negative effect on safety. \"It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just a coincidence,\" he said, \"or if there\u2019s something else going on.\"\n",

It\u2019s only a theory backed up by zilch,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnimism,\u201d I repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny coincidence, but I\u2019ve been doing some reading about it. Apparently, so-called \u2018primitive\u2019 tribes that developed in an environment where food and water were plentiful and survival was relatively easy tended to be animistic. That is, they had no concept of God or any other supernatural being. They didn\u2019t even believe in the existence of evil spirits.\u201d\nJesse looked at me quizzically.\n\u201cSo what does this have to do with language?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I began, \u201cit has everything to do with language. If you can\u2019t speak a language, then you can\u2019t communicate with anyone else. And if you can\u2019t communicate with anyone else, then you can\u2019t survive.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Jesse insisted. \u201cThere are plenty of people out there who can\u2019t speak English, but they still manage to get along just fine.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how many of them are there?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jesse answered. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure",
        "Destined to fail: Is taking the job no one wants ever a good thing?\nSo is it ever worth it to take the job no one else wants??If something doesn't pass the smell test, stay away. And if you do, be ready for what's coming.\nThey're posted on company job boards, listed on online career websites and passed along by word of mouth between friends, peers and co-workers. And while they offer potentially attractive salaries, good benefits and unending challenges, there are numerous job openings that share one current trait: No one wants them.\nRecent events in Donald Trump's White House highlighted the difficulties in filling jobs that are deemed impossible. The difficulties the president had when looking for a new chief of staff certainly mirror the process of filling other job openings throughout the country, specifically when those close to the position know that the job itself will be one that could cost them their personal and professional reputation.\nPaul Nelson, a software sales manager in New Brunswick, New Jersey, says he knows all about trying to fill a job considered impossible by his co-workers. Nelson, who asked that his real name not be used, considered himself the \"last man standing\" for the manager of his previous employer's sales group, which was responsible for selling inventory software to small and midsize firms. \"Anyone who was even remotely qualified for the job left the company or refused to toss their hat into the ring,\" says Nelson, 43. \"I was the only one who stayed.\"\nNelson, who has worked at the same company for more than 20 years, eventually accepted an offer from a competitor. He says he didn't want to leave, but he also knew he wouldn't have been able to keep up with the demands of the role. \"It was just too much for me,\" he says. \"I couldn't handle the stress.\"\nThe experience taught him a valuable lesson: If something doesn't pass the smell test, stay away. And if you do, be ready for what's coming. \"You never know what's going to come out of the woodwork,\" he says. \"There's always a chance someone else will get the job.\"\nA recent survey conducted by CareerBuilder found that nearly half (46 percent) of hiring managers say they've seen job postings for positions they can't find candidates for. That number jumps to 60 percent among millennials, the generation born between 1981 and 1996, according to the survey.",
        "Taking a room full of furniture, accents and accessories and making it look like it all belongs together may seem difficult, but it can be done. Check out these tips to learn how to tie a room together.\nTying a room together doesn\u2019t mean having to spend a lot of money or buying several new items for the room. In most cases, you can tie a room together successfully with the furniture and accent pieces you already have, by displaying them properly. Or you can add one or two new items that will make the room \u201cpop.\u201d Here are some secrets to tying a room together.\nUsing items that you have collected \u2014 through your travels, as family heirlooms or items that you just love \u2014 is the perfect way to tie a room together. Choose a few key items that suit the room best, paying attention to size, color and theme. The items do not have to all match each other, but the size of the accent pieces should reflect the scale of the room and furniture, and the collectibles should either be in a similar color grouping or contrasting colors that don\u2019t clash. Don\u2019t try to display all your collectibles in one room, however \u2014 just choose a few special pieces and place them around the room in key places.\nOne beautiful item that reflects the theme or colors of a room can tie the room together, like a large painting over the fireplace or in the focal point of the room. Make sure that the painting is well-lit so that it stands out from the rest of the room. If you want to use an accent piece that isn\u2019t part of the room\u2019s theme or color scheme, consider using a wall sconce instead. Wall sconces are a great choice because they are small enough to fit into any space without being too distracting. They also come in many different shapes and sizes, which makes it easy to find the right one for the room.\nAnother great way to tie a room together is to use accent pillows and rugs. Pillows and rugs can be placed strategically throughout the room to give it a more casual feel. For example, you could place a rug on the floor in front of a window to create a warm, inviting feeling. You could also place a rug on the back of a sofa or chair to give the room a more formal feel.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something a little more unique, consider",
        "IOWA CITY, Iowa \u2014 A black University of Iowa student lied about being the victim of a hate crime and was actually an aggressor during several drunken fights that began inside a bar, police said Tuesday.\nMarcus Owens, 19, told police that he was attacked in an alley April 30 by three white men who hurled racial slurs and beat him, damaging his eye socket, knocking out his front teeth and cutting his lips. The claim stoked safety concerns and exposed minority students\u2019 distrust of university leaders.\nBut a two-week investigation by Iowa City Police found that a heavily intoxicated Owens was an instigator during several altercations that began inside the Eden Lounge early May 1 and continued in downtown streets.\nPolice said Tuesday that Owens would not face charges for filing a false report, fighting or underage drinking, and that they would not seek restitution to recover the costs of their investigation. They said they wanted to avoid lengthy court proceedings in the case that shook the normally quiet college town.\n\u201cIt became clear at some point that the community, not Marcus, was the victim in this event and it was important to us to get the truth out there,\u201d said Capt. Troy Kelsay, who called Owens a \u201cliar\u201d at a news conference.\n\u201cI think the outcome for all is fair,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Owens may face university sanctions. University President Bruce Harreld said the school would review its policies on reporting bias incidents.\nOwens\u2019 attorney, John O\u2019Connor, said his client had no memory of the events leading up to the alleged attack. He declined to comment further.\nOwens has been suspended from the football team, which is coached by former NFL quarterback Kirk Ferentz. He also faces possible expulsion.\nUniversity officials have said they are committed to fostering a safe environment on campus. But they have faced criticism for not doing enough to protect minority students.\nThe incident occurred just days after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one counter-protester dead and dozens more injured when a car plowed into a crowd of people protesting against the white nationalist gathering.\nIowa City Mayor Bruce Teague said the city will continue to work with the university to ensure that minority students feel safe.\n\u201cWe want to make sure we do everything we can to support them,\u201d Teague said. \u201cWe",

        "President Trump deserves credit for agreeing to meet with a delegation of frustrated and emotional survivors of the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Given his all too cozy and politically motivated alliance with the National Rifle Association, he was caught between the students\u2019 demands for tighter gun restrictions and his supporters\u2019 concern about sliding down the slippery slope of Second Amendment infringement.\nAt the end of the \u201clistening session,\u201d Trump followed the NRA playbook. He offered up the gun lobby\u2019s rather minor concessions \u2014 banning bump stocks and maybe raising the legal age for purchasing a high-powered weapon of mass murder destruction from 18 to 21. You could probably count on one hand the total number of mass killings over the past three decades that those changes might have affected.\nStill, these are beneficial baby steps that can hopefully be embraced by lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including those in the GOP (which should be renamed the \u201cGun Owners Party\u201d).\nNot so palatable, and that\u2019s putting it mildly, is Trump\u2019s suggestion that we arm as many as 20% of our nation\u2019s school teachers \u2014 concealed carry for educators. Supporters of firearms-for-faculty maintain that ever since the early 1990s, when Congress established schools as gun-free zones, an armed assailant, be it a student\u2013insider or a stranger\u2013intruder, could be assured of facing little if any resistance.\nBut there\u2019s no evidence to support this claim. In fact, the opposite is true: The more guns you give teachers, the less likely they are to be able to defend themselves against an attacker who has already entered their classroom.\nIn other words, arming teachers will not make them safer. It will only make them more vulnerable to attack.\nTrump\u2019s proposal also raises the specter of teachers being forced to choose between protecting their students and defending themselves. That\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\nIt\u2019s time for Trump to stop playing politics with the lives of young people and start acting like the president of the United States of America.\n\u2014 David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.

        "Meg Whitman knows a thing or two about Herculean tasks. Sunday, she has a new one as HP splits in two.\nPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Meg Whitman knows a thing or two about Herculean tasks.\nAfter all, she did raise eBay from humble beginnings to help create an e-commerce powerhouse whose market capitalization is now $34 billion. She took on political legend Jerry Brown in an unsuccessful bid to become governor of California in 2010. And she ditched a successful career in venture capital to attempt to return an American business icon, Hewlett-Packard, to glory.\nShe apparently saved the most difficult challenge for last: Split HP into two Fortune 50 companies, each $50 billion behemoths that separately serve the PC and enterprise markets while competing with the likes of IBM, Oracle, Dell-EMC and other tech giants.\n\"We're turning around an icon... that lost its way,\" Whitman, 59, says. \"We're trying to set the company up for the next chapter by laying the pipes and remodeling the house.\"\nOn Sunday, it becomes official with the formation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which will concentrate on selling hardware such as servers to businesses in need of building their data centers, and HP Inc., which will sell PCs and printers to businesses and consumers.\nUSA TODAY gained behind-the-scenes access to Whitman, who will run HPE, and other HP executives in Palo Alto this week as they prepare to announce the split.\nWhitman, who was named CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise in April, said she's been working on the plan since January. The split is expected to be completed by the end of the year.\n\"I'm really excited about what we're going to do,\" Whitman says. \"It's a big change, but I think it's the right thing to do.\"\nThe split comes at a time when technology companies are under increasing pressure to deliver more products and services to customers faster and cheaper than ever before. It also comes amid a global economic slowdown that has led many businesses to cut back on IT spending.\n\"There's a lot of uncertainty out there,\" Whitman says. \"We have to make sure we can meet our customers' needs. We have to make sure we can continue to invest in innovation.\"\nWhitman, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from Stanford University with a degree in computer science",
        "Faceoff: Should young people have wills?\nHome Advisor\u2019s Edge September 2013 Faceoff: Should young people have wills?\nDo twenty- and thirty-somethings need wills? Experts remain divided.\nWithout a will, assets must go through the probate process. That\u2019s an immediate cost to your client\u2019s survivors. And the estate lawyer\u2019s fees aren\u2019t always a percentage of the estate. Most lawyers charge fixed amounts, which could run into thousands of dollars.\nIn most provinces, if clients don\u2019t have spouses or children, their assets go to their parents. But some young people have siblings or friends with greater financial need. Some might also want to make charitable gifts. Plus, uncertainty around how to handle an estate puts bereaved family members through much more grief.\nThere\u2019s more to a will than listing who gets what. The document should specify who manages the estate after your client dies. If she has minor children, it should address guardianship and any trust funds. Your client should also draft power of attorney and healthcare directives in case of physical or mental incapacity.\nThe healthcare directive can specify where she will live (home, hospice, LTC, etc.), what her activities (hobbies, trips, day-to-day physical activities, etc.) will be, and who can visit her. In many provinces, a client can also address end-of-life wishes, such as \u201cdo not resuscitate.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re working on a will for someone under age 30, there are a few things to keep in mind. For one thing, your client may not be aware that he or she needs a will at all. They may think they\u2019ve got everything figured out.\nAnother consideration is whether your client wants to leave anything to his or her spouse or child(ren). It\u2019s common for younger people to leave money to their parents, but it\u2019s less common for them to leave money to their spouse or child(ren), especially if they\u2019re still living at home.\nA third consideration is whether your client wants to name anyone else as executor. This person would be responsible for making sure the estate is distributed according to your client\u2019s wishes. A good rule of thumb is to avoid naming anyone who doesn\u2019t know your client well enough to make a decision about",
        "Can a computer simulation help guide the United States toward producing more and better-qualified math and science students?\nA team of engineers from the Raytheon Co. thinks so. Today, after three years of work, they join business and education supporters in unveiling a \u201csimulation and modeling\u201d computer tool designed to crunch vast amounts of data about students, teachers, and the workforce, and evaluate various mathematics and science education policies.\nCalled the \u201cU.S. STEM Education Model,\u201d the tool relies on complex algorithms and allows users to gauge the impact of policies while adjusting for more than 200 individual variables in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or \u201cSTEM\u201d education.\nThose variables include class size, teacher turnover, gender differences, and teacher salaries, as well as data from scholarly studies that have been put into the system. The tool is free and available for downloading online, though it requires simulation software.\nThe simulation-and-modeling tool, while complex, is meant to provide scholars, state and federal policymakers, and others with a way to study the effects of past, current, and future policies, said Brian H. Wells, Raytheon\u2019s chief systems engineer, who helped develop the system. Initially, it was meant to focus on how to increase the number of STEM college graduates, though it has clear applications for K-12 and the workforce, too, he noted.\nFor example, a recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that the U.S. needs to produce at least 1.5 million new STEM graduates every year to keep up with global competition. That would require an investment of $1.2 trillion over the next decade, according to the report, which was commissioned by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and released last month.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just say we need more STEM graduates,\u201d Wells told GeekWire. \u201cWe need to know what those graduates are going to do. We need to know what their skills are going to be. And we need to know if we\u2019re doing something right or wrong.\u201d\nRaytheon\u2019s simulation-and-modeling tool is one of many tools being developed by researchers and policy makers around the world to assess the impact of different policies and programs aimed at increasing the number of STEM graduates.",
        "We all know the Iranian M.O. \u2014 nuclear proliferation, Holocaust denial, threats to wipe out Israel, vicious anti-Western rhetoric, lavish sponsorship of terrorists at work attacking Israel and destabilizing Lebanon.\nIf that were not enough, we now learn that Iran has been sending agents into Iraq to destroy the fledgling democracy and supplying sophisticated roadside bombs to blow up Americans.\nLunatic state-run media keep boasting that Iran will kidnap American soldiers, shut down the Straits of Hormuz, send out global jihadists and raise the price of oil.\nMost international observers agree on two things about this loony theocracy that promises to take the world down with it: We should not yet bomb Iran, and it should not get the bomb. Yet the former forbearance could well ensure the latter reality.\nWhat, then, should the United States do other than keep offering meaningless platitudes about \"dialogue\" and \"talking\"?\nImagine that Iran is a hardboiled egg with a thin shell. We should tap it lightly wherever we can \u2014 until tiny fissures join and shatter the shell.\nWe can begin to do this by pushing international accords and doggedly ratcheting up the weak United Nations sanctions. Even if they don't do much to Iran in any significant way, the resolutions seem to enrage Ahmadinejad. And when he rages at the United Nations, he only loses further support, especially in the Third World.\nWe should start by imposing an arms embargo on Iran. The U.N. Security Council has already imposed one, but it expires next month. It should be extended for another six months or so.\nThe United States should also impose a travel ban on anyone from Iran who wants to enter the United States. This would make it harder for Iranians to sneak across our southern border.\nFinally, the United States should cut off all financial transactions with Iran, including its central bank, which controls most of the country's foreign currency reserves.\nThese measures are unlikely to have much effect on Iran's economy. But they will make it more difficult for the mullahs to fund their terrorist activities around the world.\nIn short, we should use every tool at our disposal to isolate Iran diplomatically, economically and militarily.\nIt may be too late to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. But it is never too late to prevent it from becoming a nuclear power.\n\u2014 Paul Craig Roberts is a professor of economics",

        "Oskar Groening, the Auschwitz bookkeeper who was convicted at age 94 after a Munich court cleared the way for the prosecution of low-ranking officials accused of indirectly committing Nazi war crimes, has died.

The publication wrote that prosecutors in Hanover, Germany, said Groening\u2019s lawyer had informed them of Groening\u2019s death. No cause was given.\nDubbed the \u201caccountant of Auschwitz,\u201d Groening went on trial in the northern German city of Lueneburg in April 2015, accused of complicity in the murder of at least 300,000 Jews at the concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II. His job was to collect money and valuables from prisoners\u2019 luggage and send them to Berlin.\nIn July 2015, he was sentenced to four years in prison. Initially deemed too ill for prison, he was declared fit for imprisonment in December and was scheduled to start serving his sentence soon.\nTrained as a banker, Groening told judges that he tried several times to be relocated to another post or to the front. The first time was when he saw an SS guard kill a baby by smashing it against a truck. The second was when he saw an SS soldier pour gas through a slot into a farmhouse where Jews were held. His third request to be relocated was finally accepted at the end of 1944 and he was moved to Auschwitz in January 1945.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

        "Staff photo by Cathy CramerEight municipalities are discussing joining a joint municipal court system to be hosted by Upper Deerfield Township.\nIn a cost-saving response to the mounting pressures of reduced revenue and a push toward shared services by the state, eight local municipalities are discussing unification in a joint municipal court system.\nShiloh Borough and Deerfield, Greenwich, Hopewell, Lawrence, Stow Creek, Pittsgrove and Upper Deerfield townships are in the process of establishing the logistics of a joint court system to potentially begin processing a shared caseload in January 2012.\nMunicipality officials have been meeting for months to work out the logistics of a shared system to be hosted in Upper Deerfield Township. A committee with equal representation and voting power from each municipality is expected to make decisions on such issues as personnel, facilities and other management determinations.\nAccording to a draft budget and analysis for the joint court system, the eight municipalities lost an approximated total of $242,490 in 2010 due to court expenses far exceeding revenue.\nThe 2012 joint court loss for all eight municipalities combined is tentatively projected to be $60,799 \u2014 a potential loss reduction of more than $181,000.\n\u201cEvery municipality lost money in their courts last year. Hopefully with this new structure, that\u2019ll be decreased greatly,\u201d Daddario said.\nDaddario said the municipalities are hoping to add more sessions than currently held and reduce the amount of time it will take to process cases.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at adding two or three days per week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a huge increase in staff, but we\u2019re trying to do everything we can to cut down on costs.\u201d\nUpper Deerfield Township Supervisor John Mancuso said the township has been working on the issue for several years.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Mancuso said. \u201cIt would save us a lot of money.\u201d\nDeerfield Town Supervisor Michael O\u2019Brien said he thinks the move is a good one.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a positive step forward,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time.\u201d\nO\u2019Brien said he believes the",
        "The lack of a kitchen in an Indian Lake homeowner's garage paved the way to an unprecedented ruling regarding land use rights in the borough.\nThe Somerset County Court of Common Pleas ruled July 5 that David Rohrich's 1,085 square foot car garage was not considered a residence because it \"lacks the signature component of every true residence: a kitchen.\"\nRohrich was cited by the borough's zoning hearing board for violating an ordinance that restricts each lot to one residence or dwelling. The hearing board argued that Rohrich's property violated the terms of its building permit \u2014 which prohibited \"living quarters\" \u2014 because the second floor of his garage contained plumbing, a shower and rooms that could be used to sleep in.\nJudge D. Gregory Geary wrote in an 18-page ruling that the garage cannot be considered a second dwelling without a kitchen.\n\"When one views the second story improvements objectively, all that is there is a place to sleep and shower, albeit rather comfortably,\" he wrote. \"Those accommodations are well-suited for a transient or temporary stay to be sure, but they simply do not amount to what one would commonly consider as a residence.\"\nRohrich said the borough was on a \"witch hunt.\" He argued that his garage was the first ever to be subject to inspection. The issue has been ongoing since 2006.\n\"Our plans were always laid out with what we were going to do with the garage,\" he said when reached at home last week. \"We never had any intention to build a house. We just wanted to have a place to store our cars.\"\nRohrich said he plans to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court.\n\"I'm very disappointed,\" he said. \"It's a travesty. I don't see how you can make a decision like this without looking at the whole picture.\"\nBorough officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIn other business:\n\u2022 Borough Council voted unanimously to approve a $1.2 million contract with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to clean up contaminated soil from the former site of the former Bethlehem Steel plant.\nThe DEP will remove more than 2,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the former steel mill site, located at the intersection of Route 202 and East Main Street. The project is expected to take about two years to complete.\nCouncil also approved a resolution authorizing the borough manager to enter into",
        "NORTHAMPTON -- A year after Wired West clashed with state officials over its plan to build, own, and operate a broadband network in dozens of rural communities, the group has resurfaced with \"Plan B\" and a new sense of hope that the Massachusetts Broadband Institute, or MBI, will work with them.\nOn Saturday, the cooperative hosted a well-attended meeting at JFK Middle School in Northampton where they unveiled their new concept. The room was filled with local officials from across the region, most of whom have grown frustrated with the slow pace of rural broadband deployment in the state.\nWired West is still pushing for a fiber-to-the-home network spanning up to 27 towns. Its leaders are still touting fiber as a blazing-fast, future-proof technology, and say the regional concept would be more economical than one where each town goes it alone.\nBut now, following a shift in state policy, they propose to merely operate the network instead of trying to do everything themselves, including actually stringing cable on utility poles.\nUnder the new plan, member towns would manage the build of their own \"last mile\" fiber optic networks, using state and local funding. They could optionally get help with engineering and design from MBI.\nThe town networks would then be joined in a ring topology and connected to MassBroadband123, the state-owned \"middle mile\" backbone privately operated by Axia Networks.\nWired West would continue to provide technical support, but would no longer be involved in day-to-day operations.\n\"We're not saying we're going to run the whole thing ourselves,\" said co-founder and former state Sen. Michael Rodrigues (D-Plymouth), who also serves as chairman of the House Committee on Telecommunications and Technology. \"We're just saying we want to be part of the process.\"\nRodrigues said he's been working closely with MBI since last summer, when he introduced a bill that would have required the agency to develop a regional approach to broadband deployment. He said he's pleased with the progress MBI has made so far.\n\"I think they've done an excellent job,\" Rodrigues said. \"I'm very encouraged by what I've seen.\"\nState Rep. William Straus (R-Taunton), who represents much of the same area as Rodrigues, agreed.\n\"It's a good idea,\" Straus said.",
        "Typing Assistant provides the ability to autocomplete words and save time. With a minimum of frills and an impressively large dictionary, this program will shave minutes off writing.\nThis program's interface reminded us of the word-completing software present in text messaging, but still required a visit to the Help file's simple instructions for the basics. While its functionality proved to be initially distracting, we quickly grew to anticipate it. Once we wrote a few letters (for example, \"Arr\") a small screen popped up, providing a list of possible solutions (this example ranged from Arrack, Arrange, Array, and more). We either kept typing our word or scrolled through the choices and chose the correct one. Happily, the word we needed was usually toward the top and required less than a second to pick. The time saved using this program depended heavily on its best feature, an adjustable delay. When we wanted instant help we set no delay, but when we only wanted help if we were stuck on a spelling, we set the program to a longer delay before the screen appeared. No matter how we set it, this was a fantastic option for avoiding the word processor's spelling helper and has the ability to shave minutes from projects.\nTyping Assistant comes with a 21-day trial. This program installs desktop icons without asking permission and leaves Start menu items and folders behind after uninstall.\nTyping Assistant auto-completes your frequently used words and phrases anywhere you have Internet access. You can also use Typing Assistant to spell check your emails, web pages, and other documents.\nKeyboard Shortcuts:\nCtrl+F: Finds the first letter of any word.\nCtrl+K: Finds the last letter of any word.\nCtrl+L: Finds the middle letter of any word.\nCtrl+R: Finds the end letter of any word.\nCtrl+S: Finds the start letter of any word.\nCtrl+V: Finds the end letter of any word.\nCtrl+W: Finds the beginning letter of any word.\nCtrl+X: Finds the end letter of any word.\nCtrl+Y: Finds the start letter of any word.\nCtrl+Z: Finds the end letter of any word.\nTyping Assistant is available for Mac OS X 10.6.8 and later, Windows 95/98/ME/NT 4.0",
        "This week we are going to enjoy some ancient Indian ruins and petroglyphs. Remember, you can visit both the Brooklyn Mine and today\u2019s places in a single trip, so for driving directions contact me through the Courier\u2019s senior editor, Tim Wiederaenders (use Subject: Brooklyn Rim).\nOriginally Published: October 13, 2018 8:49 p.m.\nBefore I describe today\u2019s visit, here is an update on the Brooklyn Mine I described last article. I asked readers to give me more info on this mine because my research hadn\u2019t found much. Three readers were very helpful. Cal Cordes, whose recent ancestors ran the sheep station at Cordes, told me about his visit to the mine in 1936 when he was 10. Mike Spencer and Tom Blake really know their way around the Web and have shared all sorts of info about the mine. I\u2019ll give you updates later. In future, any reader who has info to share on an Amazing Place, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.\nThere are scores of Indian ruins and hundreds of petroglyphs in the area of the Agua Fria National Monument (AFNM). It\u2019s worth repeating that the heyday for these Indians was the period between 1250 and 1450 AD (CE) \u2013 why they left isn\u2019t fully understood but probably an extended drought. Because the AFNM area is isolated, some of the ruins and petroglyphs are only accessible by foot or horseback. The best way to get there is to take Route 66 from Los Angeles to San Diego, then continue north on Highway 101 until you reach Santa Barbara. Then turn right onto State Route 1 and follow it to Santa Ynez, where you will find the entrance to the AFNM. There is no fee to enter the park, but visitors should be prepared to pay $5 per vehicle for parking.\nThe first thing you need to do is decide what you want to see. If you\u2019re looking for petroglyphs, you\u2019ve come to the right place. But if you\u2019re looking for ruins, you might want to look somewhere else. Here\u2019s a list of the most important sites:\nAgua Fria National Monument (AFNM): This is one of the largest national monuments in the U.S., covering nearly 2,000 square miles.",

        "Instead America should bring the troops home.\nAs the anniversary of the September 11 attacks draws near, the Afghanistan War\u2014the nearly seventeen-year-old conflict those terrible events spawned\u2014is seeing a change in leadership. Army Lt. Gen. Austin Scott Miller, America\u2019s ninth commander, is preparing to take charge of the effort but has already admitted to his lack of innovative thinking. At his confirmation hearing in June, he told the Senate that he couldn\u2019t guarantee a timeline for bringing U.S. troops home. This is unfortunate\u2014and expected. Despite the change of command, Miller represents the same stale thinking that has permeated U.S. foreign policy for the last two decades.\nLast Wednesday, outgoing Afghanistan commander Gen. John Nicholson, held his final press conference, where he repeated the same talking points on making progress with nothing to show for it. This comes on the heels of a very violent past few weeks in Afghanistan featuring multiple suicide bomb attacks that killed dozens. If there were true progress, America would be creating an exit plan instead of supporting indefinite sustained commitment.\nBut the Pentagon continues to argue that the Afghanistan mission is about protecting the homeland, asserting that Al Qaeda\u2019s unmolested presence there in the 1990s allowed them to carry out the attacks on 9/11. In reality, those terrible attacks were coordinated from multiple points across the globe\u2014including inside the United States. Moreover, the intelligence community missed almost two dozen opportunities to stop the attacks before they took place. The Afghan government and its American allies have also been unable to protect their own citizens from the Taliban, who are responsible for more than 90 percent of all civilian casualties in the country.\nAmerica\u2019s war in Afghanistan was never about defeating Al Qaeda or preventing another 9/11. It was always about regime change, which is why President George W. Bush launched Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in October 2001. Since then, we\u2019ve spent over $1 trillion and lost more than 2,400 American lives. We\u2019re still fighting a war that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nThe only reason we\u2019re still there is because we can\u2019t get our act together when it comes to foreign policy. We\u2019re spending trillions of dollars on wars that don\u2019t make us safer, while at the same time failing to address the real threats we face at home. We need to end this endless",
        "The University of Maryland President Wallace Loh.\nUniversity of Maryland President Wallace Loh stood before reporters Aug. 14 and apologized to the family of Jordan McNair, a football player who died days after a team workout. That day, Loh also announced a commission charged with examining the culture inside the school's embattled football program, an undertaking that could prompt sweeping changes at the state's flagship university.\nIn June, the school had contracted with an outside consulting firm to investigate the events surrounding McNair's death. But the commission Loh announced nearly two months later would be charged with a broader inquiry into the culture of the school's football program - a \"thorough investigation by an independent group,\" Loh said - following media reports that suggested some coaches were abusive toward players, relying on fear, intimidation and bullying.\nFew details about the group's work to date are publicly available, but the commission's directives and composition reveal some of the inherent obstacles that arise when independent bodies investigate problems in university athletic departments.\nIn an initial email to the newly-appointed commission members, a copy of which was viewed by The Washington Post, Loh advised that some of the allegations they would be investigating \"probably occur in every football program\" and that the line between aggressive and abusive training techniques is \"imprecise.\"\nAlso, several of the commission members have previous ties with the university and the stakeholders in the affair. One served as a personal advisor to Loh. Another is the brother of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who was suspended indefinitely for punching his then-fianc\u00e9e in an Atlantic City casino elevator in 2014.\nLoh has been under fire since McNair died May 29 after suffering cardiac arrest during a team workout. He initially said he did not know what caused the 22-year-old to collapse, but later acknowledged he should have done more to prevent it.\nMcNair's death sparked protests across the country, including one in Annapolis, Md., where he played high school football. In recent weeks, Loh has faced mounting pressure to resign or step down from his position as president. A petition calling for his ouster has garnered more than 10,000 signatures.\nOn Thursday, Loh met with students, faculty, staff and alumni to address their concerns.\n\"I am deeply sorry for the pain this tragedy has caused our community,\" Loh told the crowd, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by The Post.",
        "Last Tuesday, a farm-to-table subscription service called Local Roots NYC dropped off boxes at pickup spots in New York City including a cafe, a brew pub and the offices of BuzzFeed.\nAlongside locally grown rainbow chard, romaine lettuce and beets, some members got bottles of olive oil from Italy or bars of chocolate and bags of dried pasta, both Brooklyn-made. From Rustic Roots, an organic-food delivery service in the tristate area, members could receive fruit boxes stacked with oranges, pineapples and avocados.\nAlthough both companies use the term \u201cC.S.A.,\u201d community-supported agriculture, to describe their service, the presence of a middleman between the farmer and the customer is precisely what traditional C.S.A.s are designed to avoid. And since olives and oranges do not grow in this region, those products provide no direct income to local farmers, precisely the people the C.S.A. was invented to benefit.\nCommunity-supported agriculture was originally defined by a very particular relationship between a farm and its customers. Starting in the 1980s (earlier in Europe and Japan), members banded together to support a nearby farm with an upfront financial commitment to buy its produce.\nIt was a private transaction in which all the money went directly to the farmer. It did not rely on distributors or brick-and-mortar stores, and it gave farmers a crucial infusion of cash that allowed them to invest in new equipment, hire more workers and expand their operations.\nThe model has been around for decades, but in recent years it has become increasingly popular among consumers who want to know where their food comes from and how it was produced. The rise of social media has also made it easier than ever to find out where your favorite foods come from.\nBut while many C.S.A.s have sprung up over the past few years, they are still relatively rare in the United States. In 2016, there were only about 1,000 such programs nationwide, according to the National Community Supported Agriculture Network, a nonprofit that advocates for C.S.A.s. That number is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, as the industry continues to grow.\nLocal Roots NYC, which launched in 2014, is one of the most well-known C.S.A.s in the country.

        "The justice secretary had admitted this morning that he was giving \"further consideration\" to the case for public interest after reports over the weekend suggested reasons for the move.\nVenables, 27, was ten years old when he murdered toddler James Bulger in 1993. After being released the Ministry of Justice confirmed he was returned to jail following a \"breach of licence conditions\" on Wednesday.\nJames' mother Denise Fergus said she had a \"right to know\" why the recall had taken place.\nBut this afternoon Mr Straw told the Commons that it would not be in the public interest to make further revelations.\n\"It is critical that if charges do follow it is possible to hold a fair trial - fair for the defence and fair for the prosecution,\" he told MPs.\n\"Our motivation is solely to ensure that serious allegations are properly investigated and that justice is done. No one in this country would want anything other.\"\nMr Straw's earlier comments echoed home secretary Alan Johnson's suggestion that the public had a \"right to know\" last week.\n\"It is better to be cautious. Above all, it is not for ministers to run a criminal trial process,\" Mr Straw said earlier.\n\"I think it's pretty well known that my overriding instinct in public life is to give as much information as possible as early as possible - not to sit on things.

We will continue to work with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to see how best to proceed.\"\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: \"We can confirm that David Venables has been recalled from HMP Belmarsh due to a breach of his licence conditions.\n\"As a matter of policy, we do not comment on individual cases.\"\nJames' mother Denise Fergus said she had a \"right to know\" why the recall had taken place.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I've got a right to know why they're taking him back into custody.\n\"There's a lot of questions that need to be answered. Why did he get out? Why didn't they take him back into custody?",
        "And that's why the United States can't win.\nIn announcing last week that more U.S. forces were headed to Afghanistan, President Donald Trump remarked that \u201cthe American people are weary of war without victory.\u201d He\u2019s right about the weariness. But that very weariness is encouraged by the widespread belief that Afghanistan is the kind of war in which there is going to be a moment of victory, if only the American people support the war a little longer. And that is to misunderstand the nature of the conflict in Afghanistan.\nEver since the Taliban government was toppled in late 2001, the heart of the strategic problem that has confronted the United States and its allies in Afghanistan has been the definition of victory: How does this end? We would all be better off if we first asked what \u201cthis\u201d is. While Afghanistan is a war of sorts, it is not the sort of war in which there is likely to be a decisive moment of victory. Rather, Afghanistan is best described as an armed policing operation.\nHence in Afghanistan, security forces regularly collect evidence from the battlefield: weapons, spent bullet cases, parts from improvised explosive devices, documents, cell phones, swab tests for explosive residue, and so on. Why? Because without evidence there will be no conviction in an Afghan court, and the alleged insurgent will walk away (assuming he doesn\u2019t bribe his way out after capture, as happens all too often).\nThis summarizes the essence of the war in Afghanistan: It is a policing operation. In other words, it\u2019s a police state. This is not to say that Afghans don\u2019t have rights under international humanitarian law. They do. But they also live in a country where their basic human rights are routinely violated, including the right to freedom of expression, association, assembly, and peaceful protest. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, has called Afghanistan \u201cone of the most repressive countries in the world.\u201d\nThe United States and its allies have tried to address these violations through various means, including military force, diplomatic pressure, and economic sanctions. But none of these measures have had much effect. As a result, the United States and its allies have increasingly turned to policing operations, such as counterinsurgency and counterterrorist operations, to deal with the threat posed by the Taliban and other insurgent groups. These operations are",
