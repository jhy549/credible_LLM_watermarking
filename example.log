On the other hand, from the standpoint of users of PCs, we think that the convenience of inputting, maintaining and retrieving files is more than sufficient without putting much burden on the user. In addition, it can be assumed that the recent increase in the variety of security requirements due to legislation and social situations has led to a complex security environment that requires further considerations.

Thus, the data remains safe during transmission, saving to another place or sharing with others.
We can use hash function to generate a unique digital fingerprint for files such as image, document and database. You should know that these digital fingerprints are not easy to change after generation and also cannot be reversed into original values. So, if an unknown

Of course, there are many ways to protect us from being infected by the viruses, for example, you can close all the unnecessary programs when you are surfing the Internet, or set up a firewall program, etc., but these methods are not enough. Sometimes malicious programs will attack a computer without any reason. If you use more than one PC connected to the network, and also with USB flash drives, we must take additional protection measures. We recommend that you try to change your password periodically. This way, a hacker can’t access your account because of “lost password”. The solution is to reset to default password frequently. Then what is the other way?

The Zanu-PF candidate for Glenview West Constituency Lexton Moyo confirmed the disgruntled supporters had held meetings over possible boycotts of Chiyangwa, claiming there would be protests if he won a seat in the National Assembly.
Moyo also claimed that three members of his campaign team walked out on him during the elections due to concerns that Chiyangwa had bought votes.
There were also reports that Njabulo Ncube, a relative of youth minister Kazembe Kazembe, had endorsed Chiyangwa while Sibanda Shoko and Miftah Ally were locked in rivalry for control of the Zanu-PF branch in Zvimba South.

She said the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, the war veterans' grouping backing President Emmerson Mnangagwa, must expunge Chiyangwa from its ranks.
“As Zanu-PF there is nowhere to go. We owe it to ourselves to go for an indaba and consider a better position on what we want in terms of the party’s candidates, especially Chiyangwa," she said. "With or without the support of the entire province, we can still manage to beat him."
Similar sentiments were shared by war veteran Ndibini Themba Zimunya, who added: “I am not a Chiyangwa

Another ruling party official in Zvimba South, Ephrain Matenda, also questioned how Chiyangwa defeated five other aspiring legislators in the primary polls.
‘‘We should stop confusing the issue because what we need is a winning party and not an individual. If Chiyangwa is the best person to take Zanu-PF forward, why then should we lose an election? We expect him to get out there and campaign so that voters know who they want to elect. I think he can do better if he stops worrying about his seat, starts campaigning and talking to voters," Matenda said.

Other Zanu PF stalwarts also accused Chiyangwa of using bribery to win the primaries saying he had refused to visit the area to campaign since his nomination.
“While we were coming to attend the ZANU PF meeting at Shasha, we noticed a lot of food on our way and this made the participants confused as there had been no mention of any food to be served at the venue.

Maleka Mguni (35) a resident at Chitungwiza, concurred with Maseko saying Chiyangwa's background was 'non-people oriented'.
"Look at his projects like Chicken Inn hotel. There is nothing there for the poor man in the street. He should also visit every ward of Chitungwiza so that we know what he stands for," he said.

She alleged her defeat at the polls was because she openly supported former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa during last year's coup attempt against Mugabe.
‘‘I think I lost because I support ED (Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa),” she said. “But I am still happy because I am proudly supporting my brother (Mnangagwa). They (party leaders) say they want unity so we should put aside our differences. If they do not like what I stand for, let them stay away."

She also accused the Zanu-PF leader of using his money to bribe the electoral college delegates who voted him as the Zanu-PF flag bearer. The Zanu-PF electoral college consists of members of the youth, women and veteran organisations, which together account for more than half the votes cast in Zanu-PF congress elections held annually at the end of each year since 1976. Voting for the primary election was conducted over three consecutive weekends in June, while the results were announced on 12 July. Some of the losing candidates have since approached the courts challenging their defeat in the primary polls. But they have failed to secure an interdict restraining Zanu-PF from holding the primary election re-run due on 16 and 17 August. Meanwhile, another losing primary election candidate, Tafataona Makoni, said the party needed to conduct its primaries fairly if it wanted to retain its majority seats in the coming elections against the opposition. ‘‘I think we must do away with these irregularities because we can’t go into elections with a bad image,'' he said. ‘‘We must do away with this corrupt tendency because it is destroying our reputation.

Trosclair said he didn't hear any sirens warning residents about the approaching storms. He added that his neighborhood has a history of flooding during heavy rains.

"It sounded like a train coming," she said.
Trosclair said the family took cover in the basement but then decided to move upstairs because it wasn't flooding. They were able to go back out into the neighborhood after about half an hour.
"We saw a lot of tree limbs down," she said, adding that some homes in the area had sustained major roof damage.
According to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center, there have been 27 preliminary tornado reports so far on Tuesday.
