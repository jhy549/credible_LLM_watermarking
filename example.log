In order to solve these problems, many cryptographic algorithms have been proposed and used in practice, such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, ElGamal encryption, digital signature algorithm (DSA) and so on. Among them, the most widely used is the digital signature algorithm (DSA), which was published in 1976 by Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) in the United States. Digital Signature Algorithm (hereinafter referred to as DSA) is a public key cryptosystem based on the discrete logarithm problem in the multiplicative group of an elliptic curve over the finite field F

In order to solve these problems, many encryption algorithms have been proposed. Encryption algorithms are mainly divided into three categories: block cipher, stream cipher and public key cryptography (also known as asymmetric cryptography) [1]. Block ciphers are used to encrypt data in blocks of fixed size, such as 64 bits, 128 bits, 256 bits, 512 bits, 1024 bits, 2048 bits, 4096 bits, 8192 bits and so on. A stream cipher is a type of encryption algorithm that operates on data one bit at a time. The main difference between block ciphers and stream ciphers lies in the fact that

He added: "They didn't know what was going on. They just wanted to get rid of him.''
The Zanu-PF leader has been accused of using his position to gain votes for himself.
He has denied any wrongdoing.
In a statement issued by his office late on Sunday, Chiyangwa said: "I am very proud of my achievements in this campaign. I want to thank all those who helped me achieve this goal. I also want to express my gratitude to all those who gave their time and energy to help me achieve this goal.
