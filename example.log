"It is true that we did not get a chance to express ourselves in the primary elections," he said.
"But I am happy that we got a chance to express ourselves in the run-off elections.
"I think if you look at his track record, he does not connect with the people."
Chiyangwa has been accused of mismanaging the Zimbabwe Sports Commission (ZSC)'s sponsorship of national teams.
He has also been accused of failing to pay salaries on time.
Chiyangwa has denied these allegations, saying they were part of a smear campaign orchestrated by opposition political parties.
Last week, the United States Department of State released a report criticising the government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa for human rights abuses.
This comes amid calls for Mnangagwa to resign or be impeached over alleged gross human rights violations.

‘‘He (Chiyangwa) is a very powerful person and we don't even know how many votes he got,'' Dinha said.
Dinha added: "I think he should go back to his rural areas and talk to the people there. He doesn't need to come here and tell us what to do."
Chiyangwa denied the allegations.
"I am not aware of any such allegation," he said.
Chiyangwa is expected to face off against Zanu-PF secretary for administration Obert Mpofu in the July 30 general elections.
Chiyangwa has been accused of using his political connections to secure lucrative government contracts.
Last year, he secured a $2 million contract to refurbish the Bulawayo Sports Club.
In 2016, he secured another $2 million contract to refurbish the National Sports Stadium in Harare.

Mpofu said Chiyangwa was elected unopposed by the party's national executive committee (NEC).
"It is true that he (Chiyangwa) was elected unopposed by the NEC. He was elected unopposed by the NEC," he said.
Mpofu said Chiyangwa would work hard to ensure victory for his party at the forthcoming general elections.
‘‘He has already started working on the campaign trail.
‘‘He has already started mobilising people.

Dinha also accused Chiyangwa of using money to influence voters.
He said: "I don't think Chiyangwa has any grassroot support at all. He has been doing this kind of thing since he started his political career."

Chiyangwa, however, lost the Zanu-PF presidential race to incumbent President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa.
Mnangagwa was elected unopposed.
Chiyangwa could not be reached for comment on the allegations.

‘‘They (the Zanu-PF leaders) just told them to vote for Zanu-PF," Dinha said.
He also accused Chiyangwa of using his political connections to get votes.
"People voted for Zanu-PF, but they didn't give us any chance to tell them what we stand for. I don't think Chiyangwa knows what he stands for. He should go back to where he came from," he said.
In a bid to defend himself against the allegations, the ZimPF secretary for administration Obert Mpofu said the allegations were false.
"I want to categorically state that there is no way Chiyangwa was involved in rigging the Zanu-PF primary elections.
"His victory is based on the votes cast by members of the party who participated in the elections.
"This is the first time such a situation has ever occurred in Zimbabwean politics.
"What happened at Zvimba South was a normal democratic process," he said.
Mpofu added: "It is unfortunate that the opposition parties are resorting to mudslinging at this critical time when the country is trying to recover from the effects of the devastating Covid-19 pandemic."

In an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Zanu-PF secretary for administration Cde Simon Khaya Moyo said he could not comment on the matter since he was out of the country at the moment.
He said he would issue a response once he got back to Bulawayo.
Moyo also denied claims that Chiyangwa had been using illegal funds to campaign for his candidature in the July elections.
He said Chiyangwa had been receiving donations from well-wishers who wanted to support his candidature.
This comes amid allegations that Chiyangwa pocketed over US$10 million from the sale of Zimra bonds which were supposed to be used to pay off debts owed to the state-owned enterprise (SOE) by Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra).
According to court papers filed by former Finance minister Tendai Biti in the High Court in Harare, Zimpapers chief executive Tafadzwa Musarara was paid $3,5 million while Zesa board chairperson Justice Priscilla Chigumba was paid $
