"I don't think there was any consultation with the people before they conducted the primaries. The whole process was marred by irregularities,” he said.
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) announced the results of the primary elections late on Friday night.
Chiyangwa received 1,639 votes against his nearest rival Nkosana Dlamini-Zuma who scored 888 while Taurai Mangudya got 533 votes against his closest rival, Tendai Masuku.
The results were released hours after Zanu-PF provincial chairperson for Zvimba South, Lovemore Matuke, said the party would challenge the results at the High Court.
Matuke also accused the electoral commission of colluding with the opposition.
Matuke also alleged that the electoral commission was biased towards the opposition.
This is not the first time that the electoral commission has been accused of favouring the ruling party.
In 2013, Zanu-PF lost the presidential race to Nelson Chamisa after the electoral body declared President Emmerson Mnangagwa the winner.

In a bid to defend himself against the allegations, the ZimPF secretary for administration Obert Mpofu said the allegations were false.

‘‘He has been in power for more than 10 years and we want to know how he managed to get so much support," Dinha said.
Dinha said the party should have held a national convention before holding primaries.
‘‘The party should have held a national convention where all members can voice their concerns.
"We don’t want to see this kind of situation in the future. We want to make sure that such things don’t happen again,” Dinha said.
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) is yet to release the final list of polling stations ahead of the July 30 harmonised elections.
This comes amid claims by the opposition MDC-T led by Thokozani Khupe over alleged manipulation of the electoral process.
The MDC-T secretary-general Douglas Mwonzora yesterday said they would challenge the Zec's decision to withhold the final list of polling stations in court.
"We are still waiting for the final list from the commission. We are going to approach the High Court if the commission does not comply with the law. We will also approach the Supreme Court if the commission does not comply with the law,'' he said.
Khupe said her party had already lodged an appeal at the Supreme Court challenging the Zec's decision to withhold the final list.
"We have already lodged an appeal at the Supreme Court challenging the Zec's decision to withhold the final list.
"We are hoping that the Supreme Court will give its verdict soon," she said.

Dinha also accused Chiyangwa of using money to buy votes.
‘‘I don't know how much he spent but I can tell you that there was a lot of money spent on buying votes.

‘‘We were not given a chance to exercise our democratic rights," Dinha said.
‘‘We were not even told where the polling stations were.
‘‘This is unacceptable. We want to know how many people voted so that we can compare with the results announced by the electoral commission.''
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) last week announced the results of primary elections held in all the country’s 10 provinces.
In Zvimba South, there were two main camps — one backing Chiwenga and another supporting Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
According to the ZimEye online news website, the Chiwenga camp was led by provincial political commissar Kudakwashe Bhasikiti.
Bhasikiti could not be reached for comment yesterday.
A source within the Chiwenga camp said they would approach the courts if they were not satisfied with the results.
"We are still studying the results and if we find anything amiss we will challenge them at the High Court or the Supreme Court," the source said.
Emmerson Mnangagwa camp spokesperson George Charamba declined to comment on the matter saying he was not aware of the allegations.
‘‘As far as I'm concerned I don't have any information on this issue. Please get back to me when you have more details," he said.
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) condemned the alleged use of state resources to rig the Zanu-PF primary elections in Zvimba South.

Dinha added: ‘‘I don't know why they didn't allow us to vote. I am sure if we had been allowed to vote, we would have voted for someone else.’’
In response, Chiyangwa dismissed the allegations as baseless.
‘‘It is unfortunate that some people are trying to tarnish my image by saying I rigged the primary elections. This is not true,'' he said.
‘‘There was nothing like rigging. There was just a misunderstanding on how the primaries should be conducted.''
Chiyangwa said he was confident of winning the elections.
‘‘I am very confident that I will win the elections. The people of Zvimba South are behind me,'' he said.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were marred by violence, ballot box snatching and voter intimidation.
At least five people were killed while several others were injured when police opened fire on opposition supporters who were protesting against alleged electoral malpractices. – News Day

‘‘We do not want this kind of thing to happen to us again."
The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) which monitors elections in the country recently raised concerns over the conduct of the primary elections, saying the process was marred by irregularities.
The opposition MDC-T also expressed concern over the outcome of the primary elections and called on the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) to nullify the results and order a fresh poll.
In a statement, the MDC-T said: "The MDC-T calls upon the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) to declare null and void the Zanu-PF primary elections held on Saturday, June 9, 2018.
‘‘The primary elections held at various polling stations across the country have been marred by gross violations of electoral laws and procedures.
"Zec should use all available constitutional and legal mechanisms to nullify these elections and order a fresh election."
Meanwhile, the Zanu-PF national political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere is set to defend his Bulawayo Central parliamentary seat next year after winning the primary elections.
Kasukuwere won the primary elections with a huge margin ahead of his closest challenger Tichafuthi Mpofu of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), who polled 609 votes to Kasukuwere’s 1 061.
The two are expected to face off against each other in the July 30 general elections.

‘‘This is unacceptable. We want to know how many people voted so that we can challenge them in court.
‘‘We do not want this kind of thing to happen to us again."
The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) which monitors elections in the country recently raised concerns over the conduct of the primary elections, saying the process was marred by irregularities.
The opposition MDC-T also expressed concern over the outcome of the primary elections and called on the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) to nullify the results and order a fresh poll.
In a statement, the MDC-T said: "The MDC-T calls upon the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) to declare null and void the Zanu-PF primary elections held on Saturday, June 9, 2018.
‘‘The primary elections held at various polling stations across the country have been marred by gross violations of electoral laws and procedures.
"Zec should use all available constitutional and legal mechanisms to nullify these elections and order a fresh election."
Meanwhile, the Zanu-PF national political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere is set to defend his Bulawayo Central parliamentary seat next year after winning the primary elections.
Kasukuwere won the primary elections with a huge margin ahead of his closest challenger Tichafuthi Mpofu of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), who polled 609 votes to Kasukuwere’s 1 061.
The two are expected to face off against each other in the July 30 general elections.

‘‘We were not given an opportunity to participate in the primary elections.
‘‘We were not even given a chance to campaign for ourselves.
‘‘This is what we call rigging," Dinha said.
Dinha accused Chiyangwa of using his personal wealth to secure the party nomination.
‘‘He has been using his influence to ensure that he gets the nomination.
"I don't know how much he spent on the nomination papers.
"But I can assure you that if he is elected, he will do everything possible to make sure he gets the seat," he said.
The Zimbabwe Independent could not independently verify the allegations.
However, sources close to Chiwenga told The Herald yesterday that the Zanu PF secretary for administration, Obert Mpofu, was behind the allegations.
Mpofu is believed to have been unhappy with Chiwenga’s decision to run for the parliamentary seat.
‘‘Obert Mpofu is very angry with Chiwenga.
"It is true that he (Chiwenga) wanted to run for the Zanu-PF chairperson position.
"But Chiwenga decided to run for the Zanu-PF secretary for administration post.
"Mpofu felt that Chiwenga was better placed to lead the party at this time when the country is facing economic challenges," the source said.
The ZimLive online newspaper reported yesterday that Chiwenga was expected to appear in court next week to face charges relating to the alleged illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition.
The charges relate to an incident where he was caught with a.22 calibre rifle and two live rounds of ammunition in Harare last year.
According to the charge sheet obtained by the newspaper, the offence occurred on February 14, 2019, at around 11:00am, when Chiwenga appeared before Magistrate Mr Tawanda Chitapi charged with contravening Section 29(1)(b) of the Arms Act which states that any person who possesses a firearm without a licence shall be guilty of an offence

‘‘He (Chiyangwa) does not listen to the people. He just listens to those who are close to him," Dinha said.
Dinha also accused Chiyangwa of using his influence to rig the primary elections.
‘‘I don't know how he managed to get so many votes. I don't know why he got more than 50 percent of the total votes cast.
‘‘It is very unfortunate that we have a person like this who does not care about the people of Zvimba South.''
Chiyangwa could not be reached for comment when contacted by NewZimbabwe.com.
The Zanu-PF secretary for administration Obert Mpofu told NewZimbabwe.com that the party would investigate the allegations against Chiyangwa.
Mpofu said: "We will look into the matter and see if there is any truth to them. If there is anything untoward, we will deal with it accordingly."
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) yesterday confirmed that it had received reports of irregularities in the Zanu-PF primary elections.
Zec chairperson Justice Priscilla Chigumba said the electoral body had already started investigating the claims.
"We have received reports of irregularities in the Zanu-PF primary elections. We are looking into the matter and we will report back to the public once we have completed our investigations," Chigumba said.
She added: "We want to assure the nation that we are committed to conducting free, fair and credible elections on July 30."
The Zanu-PF primaries were marred by violence which left at least six people dead and scores injured.
The violence erupted after rival factions within the ruling party clashed over control of key positions ahead of the July 30 elections. – Newzimbabwe.com

‘‘We were not even told where the polling stations were.
‘‘This is unacceptable. We want to know where we are supposed to vote.
‘‘We do not want this kind of thing to happen to us again."
In an interview with NewsDay Weekender yesterday, provincial chairperson Lovemore Matuke denied the allegations.
"There is nothing like that. I don't know where you got that from. The whole process was fair and transparent," he said.
"I am surprised by these allegations. There is nothing like that at all.
"It was a peaceful process and there was nothing untoward or illegal about it. People should just stop talking nonsense."
The primary elections were held on May 11 and 12.
According to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC)'s voter registration roll, more than 200 000 people voted in the primary elections.
The number of voters is likely to rise when the final list of registered voters is released before the July 30 harmonised elections.
Meanwhile, the Zanu-PF national political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere has been barred from holding any public office for the next five years following his conviction for subverting a democratically elected government.
The Supreme Court upheld the Constitutional Court's decision to uphold the criminal charges against Kasukuwere.
Kasukuwere is currently out on bail pending an appeal against the High Court's judgment that set aside the criminal case against him.
The High Court found that the state failed to provide evidence linking him to the alleged offence of subversion.
The High Court also quashed the charge of inciting violence against then Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko during the November 2017 military coup which toppled Mugabe.
The High Court also ruled that the State did not prove its prima facie case to justify the arrest and subsequent detention of Kasukuwere without trial.
The Supreme Court overturned the acquittal of Kasukuwere by the Harare magistrate's court in October last year, saying the lower court erred in finding him not guilty.

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his wealth to bribe delegates ahead of the primary election.
In an interview with NewZimbabwe.com this week, Zimbabwe Independent political analyst Rashweat Mukundu echoed similar sentiments.
“I am not saying Chiyangwa is corrupt. I just want to know where he got all the money he used to buy votes in the primary elections," he said.
He added: "There is nothing wrong with being rich. But you should not use your money to bribe others to do what they don’t want to do. This is a democratic country and we must elect leaders through free and fair elections."
Chiyangwa could not be reached for comment as he was reportedly attending a football match at the National Sports Stadium in Bulawayo.
His campaign team, however, rubbished claims that he had bribed his way into the party's ticket.
“It is unfortunate that people are now accusing Chiyangwa of bribing his way into Zanu PF primaries. These are malicious lies meant to tarnish the reputation of a hard-working and principled leader," spokesperson Tendai Biti said in a statement.
Biti said Chiyangwa's credentials were impeccable and he deserved to be the party's candidate.
“The truth of the matter is that he has been working tirelessly to improve the image of Zimbabwe internationally. He is one of the few Zimbabweans who have invested millions of dollars in Zimbabwe," he said.
Biti said Chiyangwa's opponents were simply jealous of his achievements and wanted to tarnish his name.
Chiyangwa is currently embroiled in a legal battle with soccer giants Manchester United over breach of contract.
Manchester United sued Chiyangwa for $5 million (about R68 million) in 2015 after he failed to pay them for

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his wealth to buy votes during the primary elections.
‘‘I am not saying he bribed people, but I can tell you that there were people who were given money to vote for him," she said.
‘‘People were told that if they voted for him they would get $100 each.
"It is unfortunate that we have a leader who does not know how to relate with ordinary people."
Another Zanu-PF supporter who spoke on condition of anonymity said Chiyangwa's nomination was a slap in the face for Zimbabweans who were struggling to make ends meet.
‘‘He is a rich man who does not understand the challenges faced by ordinary people.
"His nomination is an insult to those who are living below the poverty datum line (PDL).
"How do you expect them to vote for him when they are struggling to put food on the table?"
But Chiyangwa defended himself against the allegations.
‘‘I don't know where these people are getting their information from.
"They are just making up stories," he said.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were marred by violence which left one person dead and several others injured.
A total of 26 candidates contested the primary elections in Zvimba South constituency.
Chiyangwa beat his closest rival Tinomuda Kapfidze by more than 5 000 votes.
Kapfidze came second after garnering 1 879 votes while the third place went to Nkululeko Dube who got 1 598 votes.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were held at the weekend amid reports that the ruling party was divided into two factions — Team Lacoste and Generation 40 (G40).
Lacoste is reportedly led by Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, while G40 is headed by First Lady Grace Mugabe.

‘‘We were not given a chance to exercise our democratic rights," Dinha said.
‘‘We were not even told where the polling stations were.
‘‘This is unacceptable. We want to know where we are supposed to vote.
‘‘We do not want this kind of thing to happen to us again."
In an interview with NewsDay Weekender yesterday, provincial chairperson Lovemore Matuke denied the allegations.
"There is nothing like that. I don't know where you got that from. The whole process was fair and transparent," he said.
"I am surprised by these allegations. There is nothing like that at all.
"It was a peaceful process and there was nothing untoward or illegal about it. People should just stop talking nonsense."
The primary elections were held on May 11 and 12.
According to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC)'s voter registration roll, more than 200 000 people voted in the primary elections.
The number of voters is likely to rise when the final list of registered voters is released before the July 30 harmonised elections.
Meanwhile, the Zanu-PF national political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere has been barred from holding any public office for the next five years following his conviction for subverting a democratically elected government.
The Supreme Court upheld the Constitutional Court's decision to uphold the criminal charges against Kasukuwere.
Kasukuwere is currently out on bail pending an appeal against the High Court's judgment that set aside the criminal case against him.
The High Court found that the state failed to provide evidence linking him to the alleged offence of subversion.
The High Court also quashed the charge of inciting violence against then Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko during the November 2017 military coup which toppled Mugabe.
The High Court also ruled that the State did not prove its prima facie case to justify the arrest and subsequent detention of Kasukuwere without trial.
The Supreme Court overturned the acquittal of Kasukuwere by the Harare magistrate's court in October last year, saying the lower court erred in finding him not guilty.

‘‘We were not allowed to vote at all. We were told to go back home and wait for the results which never came,'' he said.
Dinha added: ‘‘I don't know why they didn't allow us to vote. I am sure if we had been allowed to vote, we would have voted for someone else.’’
In response, Chiyangwa dismissed the allegations as baseless.
‘‘It is unfortunate that some people are trying to tarnish my image by saying I rigged the primary elections. This is not true,'' he said.
‘‘There was nothing like rigging. There was just a misunderstanding on how the primaries should be conducted.''
Chiyangwa said he was confident of winning the elections.
‘‘I am very confident that I will win the elections. The people of Zvimba South are behind me,'' he said.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were marred by violence, ballot box snatching and voter intimidation.
At least five people were killed while several others were injured when police opened fire on opposition supporters who were protesting against alleged electoral malpractices. – News Day

‘"He (Chiyangwa) used his money to buy votes," he told NewsDay.
"I am not sure why they wanted him. He is not even from here. I don't know how he came here.
"He is not even connected with the people. He is just someone coming from outside."
Chiyangwa could neither confirm nor deny allegations of rigging the primary elections when contacted by The Herald yesterday.
But he dismissed claims that he rigged the primary elections as "baseless and false".
‘‘It is unfortunate that such lies have been peddled against me by disgruntled elements within the party who want to derail my efforts to unite the party and bring back its glory days," Chiyangwa said.
"I am confident that we, as Zanu-PF, will retain power at the next general elections and continue to serve the nation with distinction.”
Chiyangwa said he was ready to face any challenge.
The Zvimbabweshire legislator, who is also the Zifa vice-chairperson for the Midlands province, said he would work hard to ensure that the party retained power at the next general elections.
‘‘Our focus now is on ensuring that we retain power at the next general elections and continue to serve the nation with distinction," Chiyangwa said.
"As a party, we have resolved to work tirelessly to ensure that we remain in power.
"I, therefore, urge all party members to rally behind me.’’
Chiyangwa is also the chairman of Zanu-PF in Matabeleland North.

‘‘We were not given a chance to exercise our democratic rights," Dinha said.
‘‘We were not even told where the polling stations were.
‘‘This is unacceptable. We want to know where we are supposed to vote.
‘‘We do not want this kind of thing to happen to us again."
In an interview with NewsDay Weekender yesterday, provincial chairperson Lovemore Matuke denied the allegations.
"There is nothing like that. I don't know where you got that from. The whole process was fair and transparent," he said.
"I am surprised by these allegations. There is nothing like that at all.
"It was a peaceful process and there was nothing untoward or illegal about it. People should just stop talking nonsense."
The primary elections were held on May 11 and 12.
According to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC)'s voter registration roll, more than 200 000 people voted in the primary elections.
The number of voters is likely to rise when the final list of registered voters is released before the July 30 harmonised elections.
Meanwhile, the Zanu-PF national political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere has been barred from holding any public office for the next five years following his conviction for subverting a democratically elected government.
The Supreme Court upheld the Constitutional Court's decision to uphold the criminal charges against Kasukuwere.
Kasukuwere is currently out on bail pending an appeal against the High Court's judgment that set aside the criminal case against him.
The High Court found that the state failed to provide evidence linking him to the alleged offence of subversion.
The High Court also quashed the charge of inciting violence against then Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko during the November 2017 military coup which toppled Mugabe.
The High Court also ruled that the State did not prove its prima facie case to justify the arrest and subsequent detention of Kasukuwere without trial.
The Supreme Court overturned the acquittal of Kasukuwere by the Harare magistrate's court in October last year, saying the lower court erred in finding him not guilty.

‘"He (Chiyangwa) used his money to buy votes," he told NewsDay.
"I am not sure why they wanted him. He is not even from here. I don't know how he came here.
"He is not even connected with the people. He is just someone coming from outside."
Chiyangwa could neither confirm nor deny allegations of rigging.
When asked about claims, he said: "You are talking to me now. You can talk to my lawyers if you want to ask them about this issue."
Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) chairperson Priscilla Chigumba yesterday dismissed claims that the electoral body was biased. She said Zec was ready for the general elections and urged all political parties and stakeholders to cooperate with the commission to ensure free, fair and credible elections.
‘‘Zimbabweans have been very clear on what they want in the elections. They want change. They want a new dispensation. They want a better Zimbabwe. We are ready for the elections and we urge everyone to play their part in ensuring free, fair and credible elections," she said. – News Day/ZimInd

"I don't know why they (Zimbabwe Electoral Commission) didn't give us an opportunity to express ourselves," Dinha said.

Dinha also accused Chiyangwa of using his political influence to get votes.
"He (Chiyangwa) uses his political influence to get votes," he said.

She also accused the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) of bias.
"I don't think Zec is independent,'' Maseko said.
"They are biased. They are not impartial."
Anthony Nyamupinga, another Zanu PF activist, echoed the same sentiments saying, "As a party, we're not happy."
Zvimba South legislator, Tawanda Chimhundu could not be reached for comment.
Chinyangwa, however, denied the claims.
"These are just lies. I am very popular in my constituency, so there is no way they can say I do not have grassroots support.
"I have been in politics for a long time, so I know what I am doing.
"I am confident of winning the by-election because I have the backing of President Emmerson Mnangagwa."
Mnangagwa recently appointed Chiwenga's wife Retired Lieutenant-General Dr Christine Makwavarirwa-Chiwenga, who is a medical practitioner at ParirenyatwaGroup of Hospitals in Bulawayo,tobeZec chairperson.
It remains unclear whether this appointment will affectthebiasaccusations.

"He does not know how to talk to ordinary people. He does not understand their challenges," she said.
Another losing candidate, Tinashe Ndlovu, echoed similar sentiments, saying Chiyangwa was unpopular.
"People do not like Chiyangwa. They do not want him as their MP. We need someone who can connect with the people on the ground, not just the elite," he said.
In an interview with NewsDay this week, Chiyangwa defended his candidature, saying he was popular among Zanu-PF members.
"I am very popular in Zanu-PF. If you look at my track record, I have never lost an election since 1987. I have always been voted into office by the majority of the electorate.
"So, if you ask me whether I am popular or not, I would say I am more popular than most politicians," he said.
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) secretary-general Japhet Moyo also came out guns blazing against Chiyangwa, accusing him of using money to buy votes during the primaries.
"It is sad that we have a situation where money is being used to buy votes. This should not be allowed to happen in any democratic society.
"This is a clear case of abuse of power and corruption," Moyo said.
"As trade unionists, we cannot condone such behaviour.
"We call upon all political parties to desist from buying voters through bribery and intimidation."
But Chiyangwa hit back, accusing Moyo of trying to tarnish his image.
"Moyo is a disgruntled person who wants to tarnish my good name.
"Why is Moyo talking about me? Is he jealous of my success?" he asked.
Chiyangwa added: "These are the same people who wanted me to go to jail when I was accused of fraud.

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his wealth to buy votes during the primary elections.
‘‘We were shocked when we realised that he was spending more than $100 per person to buy votes.
"How can you spend such an amount of money to buy votes when there are so many poor people in the area?"
Masego Moyo, another losing candidate in the primary elections, echoed similar sentiments, saying Chiyangwa was not popular in the area and would struggle to win the seat if he stood as an independent candidate in the by-election, which is expected to take place next week.
‘‘There is no way he can win this seat as an independent candidate because he is not popular here,’’ he told the Daily News on Sunday.
‘‘The majority of the people in this area are poor and they cannot afford to give him money to buy their votes like what happened during the party primaries.’’
But Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) secretary-general Japhet Sibanda defended the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) president saying he had done nothing wrong in winning the party primary elections and should be allowed to go ahead.
"As Zanu PF members, Chiyangwa has every right to stand,'' Sibanda said.
"The problem is that, as Zanu PF supporters, we, too, want him out.
"The issue here is that, as Zanu PF supporters, Chiyangwa has every right to stand,'' Sibanda said.
"As Zanu PF members, Chiyangwa has every right to stand,'' Sibanda said.Sibanda urged Zanu PF, which he said was "infiltrated'' by Chiyangwa’s opponent faction,

"The whole process was marred by irregularities," Dinha said.
"We don't understand what happened. We were not allowed to vote at all. We were just told to turn up at the polling station on the day of the election.''
Another losing candidate, Tafadzwa Chitakunye, said there was a lot of confusion at the polling station where voting was taking place.
''I went to vote at the polling station but when I got there, they told me to go to another polling station,'' he said.
"When I came back to the polling station, I found out that I had already voted.
"There was so much confusion at the polling station."
Emmerson Mnangagwa, who lost the Zvimba North seat to his wife, Auxillia Mnangagwa, called on Zanu PF supporters to rally behind ZimPF candidates in the coming elections.
Mnangagwa also accused Chiyangwa of working with the opposition MDC Alliance led by Morgan Tsvangirai to destabilise the country through violent protests.
Tsvangirai's spokesperson Luke Tamborinyoka dismissed the claims, saying Chiyangwa was trying to divert attention from the fact that he was not popular with ordinary Zimbabweans and could not win an election on his own. – NewZimbabwepost

‘‘The process was unfair. We did not even get a chance to cast our votes. The results were announced before we were allowed to cast our votes.
‘‘He (Chiyangwa) used money and other underhand tactics to win the primary elections.
‘‘People should not vote for him. He does not have the support of the grassroots.''
Another losing candidate in the primary elections said they would approach the courts to challenge Chiyangwa's victory in the parliamentary elections.
‘‘As a result of what happened in the primary elections we have decided to go to court to challenge his victory in the parliamentary elections,'' said the candidate whose name could not be revealed for fear of victimisation.
Zanu-PF spokesperson Patrick Chinamasa said: "The issue you are referring to has already been dealt with".
"I cannot comment further."
The Zanu-PF primaries' controversy comes at a timewhen President Emmerson Mnangagwa is trying hard to win back the trust of Zimbabweans following his ouster in November last year.

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his position at the football governing body to solicit votes from soccer fans in the area.
“I am sure if we were to go to Bulawayo or any other province we would hear similar sentiments," she said.
"People don’t know why they are voting for Chiyangwa."
Chiyangwa could not be reached for comment as his phone rang unanswered when The Herald tried to contact him on Tuesday.
Last week, Zanu PF spokesperson Simon Khaya Moyo dismissed reports that the ruling party was divided over the nomination of Chiyangwa as its parliamentary candidate.
“There is no division in Zanu PF. We are solidly behind President Mnangagwa and all those nominated by the party,” he said.
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) secretary-general Japhet Moyo said Chiyangwa's victory was an indication that the country's electoral system needed to be overhauled ahead of next year's harmonised elections.
Moyo said Chiyangwa's victory should send a clear message to Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) chairperson Justice Priscilla Chigumba and her team to urgently address issues of transparency and credibility before the 2018 polls.
He warned that failure to do so would result in another disputed poll like what happened during the 2008 elections which were marred by violence and intimidation.
Meanwhile, Harare West MP Jessie Majome (MDC Alliance) said the manner in which Chiyangwa emerged victorious at the Zanu-PF primaries was worrying and raised questions about the fairness of the upcoming polls.

‘‘He does not even know where his constituents live, let alone what they want,’’ she said.
Another losing candidate, Tinashe Ndlovu, also accused the football boss of using money to buy votes during the primary elections held last month.
Ndlovu, who contested the primary elections on an independent ticket, said he lost by a wide margin despite having more than 2 500 votes against the 167 votes garnered by the Zifa president at the time of going to print last week.
‘‘My opponent spent over $200 000 to buy votes while I spent less than $20 000,’’ he told the Daily News.
‘‘It is unfortunate that someone like him can use money to buy votes.’’
Chiyangwa could not be reached for comment.
Hardlife Mudzingwa (Harare East constituency chairperson) and Elias Mudzingwa (Victory Park ward chairman), however, denied claims made by the losing candidates.

Dinha said the party had failed to engage its members in the area to help them decide who should be the party's candidate for the upcoming elections.
Eddie Ncube, another losing presidential aspirant, said there was nothing wrong with rigging the elections, adding that they would continue to fight for their rights in the courts.
Efforts to get comments from the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) for comment proved fruitless as officials could not be reached at press time.
Yesterday, ZimEye reported that a group calling itself Concerned Patriotic Citizens (CPC) has written to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) demanding a probe into the alleged rigging of the party's primary elections by the Zimbabwean Football Association.
The letter was addressed to the commission's chairman Justice Loice Matanda-Moyo, secretary-general Lovemore Madhuku and Zec acting chief executive Tawanda Majoni.
This comes barely a week after Zec announced that it would conduct an investigation into the primary elections held on June 24 and 25 in the country.
During the primaries, Chiwenga was endorsed as the party's candidate in the forthcoming elections while Mnangagwa lost the race to become the party's spokesperson. — @mashnetzvizhi

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his wealth to bribe delegates ahead of the primary election.
In an interview with NewZimbabwe.com this week, Zimbabwe Independent political analyst Rashweat Mukundu echoed similar sentiments, saying Chiyangwa's candidature would not help Zanu-PF's fortunes at the polls.
He said Chiyangwa's association with President Emmerson Mnangagwa was likely to alienate many voters who were still angry over the way former president Robert Mugabe was forced out of office in November 2017.
Asked whether Chiyangwa's candidature could harm Zanu-PF's chances of retaining its majority in the National Assembly in the upcoming elections.
‘‘Yes, I think so. If you take into account the fact that most of the people who voted for Mugabe during the referendum (which led to his removal) are now disenchanted with the new government, then Chiyangwa's candidature may be a liability rather than an asset," he said.
But Chiyangwa defended himself, saying he won the primary election fair and square.
“I am not worried about my opponent’s claims that I bribed them with money or any other thing," he said.
‘‘They can say whatever they want. I don’t know what their agenda is. I don’t know what their motive is. All I know is that I was elected through the ballot box."
Chiyangwa also dismissed claims that he lacked grassroots support, saying he won the primary election by a wide margin.
“The results speak for themselves," he told NewZimbabwe.com.
“I won the primary election by a wide margin. I won by 58% against my closest rival who got 42%.
“So if you ask me, do I have grassroots support, the answer is yes.
“I have been involved in politics since 1990 when we formed the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU)."
Chiyangwa also rubbished claims that he was a member of the G40 cabal, which was reportedly behind the sacking of Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga in 2017.
He said he was never a member of G40.
‘‘That is absolute nonsense. I was never a member of G40," he said.

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his wealth to buy votes during the primary elections.
‘‘I am not saying he bribed people, but I can tell you that there were people who were given money to vote for him," she said.
‘‘People were told that if they voted for him they would get $100 each.
"It is unfortunate that we have a leader who does not know how to relate with ordinary people."
Another Zanu-PF supporter who spoke on condition of anonymity said Chiyangwa's nomination was a slap in the face for Zimbabweans who were struggling to make ends meet.
‘‘He is a rich man who does not understand the challenges faced by ordinary people.
"His nomination is an insult to those who are living below the poverty datum line (PDL).
"How do you expect them to vote for him when they are struggling to put food on the table?"
But Chiyangwa defended himself against the allegations.
‘‘I don't know where these people are getting their information from.
"They are just making up stories," he said.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were marred by violence which left one person dead and several others injured.
A total of 26 candidates contested the primary elections in Zvimba South constituency.
Chiyangwa beat his closest rival Tinomuda Kapfidze by more than 5 000 votes.
Kapfidze came second after garnering 1 879 votes while the third place went to Nkululeko Dube who got 1 598 votes.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were held at the weekend amid reports that the ruling party was divided into two factions — Team Lacoste and Generation 40 (G40).
Lacoste is reportedly led by Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, while G40 is headed by First Lady Grace Mugabe.
The two factions have been engaged in a bitter battle for control of the ruling party since the ouster of long-serving President Robert Mugabe in November last year.

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his wealth to bribe delegates ahead of the primary election.
In an interview with NewZimbabwe.com this week, Zimbabwe Independent political analyst Rashweat Mukundu echoed similar sentiments, saying Chiyangwa's candidature would not help Zanu-PF's fortunes at the polls.
He said Chiyangwa's association with President Emmerson Mnangagwa was likely to alienate many voters who were still angry over the way former president Robert Mugabe was forced out of office in November 2017.
Asked whether Chiyangwa's candidature could harm Zanu-PF's chances of retaining its majority in the National Assembly in the upcoming elections.
‘‘Yes, I think so. If you take into account the fact that most of the people who voted for Mugabe during the referendum (which led to his removal) are now disenchanted with the new government, then Chiyangwa's candidature may be a liability rather than an asset," he said.
But Chiyangwa defended himself, saying he won the primary election fair and square.
“I am not worried about my opponent’s claims that I bribed them with money or any other thing," he said.
‘‘They can say whatever they want. I don’t know what their agenda is. I don’t know what their motive is. All I know is that I was elected through the ballot box."
Chiyangwa also dismissed claims that he lacked grassroots support, saying he won the primary election by a wide margin.
“The results speak for themselves," he told NewZimbabwe.com.
“I won the primary election by a wide margin. I won by 58% against my closest rival who got 42%.
“So if you ask me, do I have grassroots support, the answer is yes.
“I have been involved in politics since 1990 when we formed the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU)."
Chiyangwa also rubbished claims that he was a member of the G40 cabal, which was reportedly behind the sacking of Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga in 2017.
He said he was never a member of G40.
‘‘That is absolute nonsense. I was never a member of G40," he said.

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his wealth to buy votes during the primary elections.
‘‘I am not saying he bribed people, but I can tell you that there were people who were given money to vote for him," she said.
‘‘People were told that if they voted for him they would get $100 each.
"It is unfortunate that we have a leader who does not know how to relate with ordinary people."
Another Zanu-PF supporter who spoke on condition of anonymity said Chiyangwa's nomination was a slap in the face for Zimbabweans who were struggling to make ends meet.
‘‘He is a rich man who does not understand the challenges faced by ordinary people.
"His nomination is an insult to those who are living below the poverty datum line (PDL).
"How do you expect them to vote for him when they are struggling to put food on the table?"
But Chiyangwa defended himself against the allegations.
‘‘I don't know where these people are getting their information from.
"They are just making up stories," he said.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were marred by violence which left one person dead and several others injured.
A total of 26 candidates contested the primary elections in Zvimba South constituency.
Chiyangwa beat his closest rival Tinomuda Kapfidze by more than 5 000 votes.
Kapfidze came second after garnering 1 879 votes while the third place went to Nkululeko Dube who got 1 598 votes.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were held at the weekend amid reports that the ruling party was divided into two factions — Team Lacoste and Generation 40 (G40).
Lacoste is reportedly led by Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, while G40 is headed by First Lady Grace Mugabe.
The two factions have been engaged in a bitter battle for control of the ruling party since the ouster of long-serving President Robert Mugabe in November last year.

But when contacted for comment Chiyangwa defended himself, saying he won the primary election fair and square.
Chiyangwa also dismissed allegations that he bribed his way into winning the primary elections.
Chiyangwa said he was not worried about the criticism levelled against him and vowed to work hard to ensure victory in the general elections.
“I am not worried at all,” he said. “People can say what they want about me, but I will continue to work hard to ensure that I retain my seat (in the National Assembly).”
Chiyangwa also rubbished claims that he was a member of the G40 cabal, which was reportedly led by Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa.

He said Chiyangwa's opponents were simply jealous of his achievements and wanted to tarnish his image ahead of the elections.

“His attitude could cost him dearly at the ballot box. If you look at his track record, he has been involved in several disputes over the years. He is not liked by most Zimbabweans."
Another aspirant, Tendai Ndlovu, who came second in the primary elections blamed Chiyangwa's 'dictatorial' tendencies.
But Chiyangwa's spokesperson Lance Mambondiyani dismissed the claims.
“It is unfortunate that we still have politicians who want to play dirty politics even when they know their time is up,” he said.
“This is a clear indication that these guys are desperate for power. They have nothing else to offer.
“They should rather concentrate on campaigning for votes than engaging in mudslinging."
Chiyangwa has been embroiled in numerous scandals since he became Zifa president in 2015.
He has been accused of misappropriating millions of dollars belonging to the soccer governing body, which is currently facing bankruptcy due to huge debts.

"I am saying this openly because I do not want to go to jail for telling the truth," she said.
"Even before the primaries, we were told that if we lost, we would be arrested and taken to jail.
"We were also told that if we wanted to be nominated, we should pay US$500 each.
"But when I went to pay, I was told that the money had been deducted from my winnings."
Maseko added that during the nomination process, some Zanu-PF officials tried to intimidate her into dropping out of the race.
"They were threatening to take me to the police station and accuse me of being a thief.
"But I told them that if they thought I was stealing their money, let them go ahead and take me to the police station

She also accused the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) boss, Peter Mutasa, of interfering in Zanu-PF's primary elections.
Maseko claimed Mutasa instructed his supporters to back Chiyangwa's candidature.
"The problem we have now is that Mutasa wants to control everything. He is trying to dictate how things should be done in Zanu-PF," she said.
"People are saying they don't want Chiyangwa because he does not belong to this area.
"I am telling you, if Chiyangwa loses the elections, he will blame Mutasa for the loss."
Another Zanu-PF official, who declined to be named for fear of being victimised by the influential tycoon, described Chiyangwa as "an arrogant man".
He said the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) commander General Constantino Chiwenga was behind the Zanu-PF primary elections debacle.
"It is General Chiwenga who brought Chiyangwa into the party.
"He is the one who pushed for his nomination as the Zanu-PF candidate in the forthcoming general elections.
"He is very close to President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa.
"That is why there is nothing anyone can do against him.
"Even when he lost the primaries, he still got a chance to stand again through the intervention of Chiwenga.
"There is no way someone like him can fail in the elections," the source said.
But Zanu-PF national political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere dismissed the allegations as baseless.

“We were told that if we don’t accept the results we would be expelled from the party,'' she said.
Another losing aspirant, Sibusiso Ndebele, also said Chiyangwa's victory was not legitimate.
"The primary elections were marred by irregularities,'' Ndebele said.
"There was no transparency whatsoever during the nomination process.
"People were intimidated into withdrawing their candidacies.
"I am still shocked that Chiyangwa emerged victorious.
"It was a clear case of manipulation."
He said Chiyangwa should not be given a free ride in the forthcoming general elections.
"We are going to do everything in our power to ensure that he does not get a seat in the National Assembly," he said.
"We will mobilise all our resources to ensure that he is voted out.
"This is not about politics, this is about defending democracy.
"Our children deserve better political leadership than that which Chiyangwa offers."
Chiyangwa was unavailable for comment when contacted by NewsDay on Wednesday.
Earlier in the week, his campaign manager Kudzai Bhasikiti said Chiyangwa was ready to defend his mandate at the polls.
"I want to thank everyone who voted for me. I am humbled by the overwhelming show of support.
"As you can see, there is a lot of work that needs to be done, so I urge you to continue voting for me," he said.
"My opponent has been spreading falsehoods about my candidature.
"These are just malicious lies meant to discredit my candidature.
"I am ready to face them in the polling booths.

She also accused the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) vice-president Japhet Moyo of being behind Chiyangwa's nomination.
Maseko said Moyo had approached her and asked her to step down so that he could nominate his preferred candidate.
“Moyo came to me and said: ‘I want you to drop out of the race so I can put up my candidate.’ He told me that if I don’t do this then I would not be able to get any funding for my campaign,’’ she said.
Maseko said she rejected the offer.
Another Zanu-PF supporter in the area, who requested anonymity for fear of being victimised, said they were unhappy with Chiyangwa's nomination.
He said Chiyangwa had no support base in the constituency.
"The problem is that we don’t have confidence in him. He doesn’t even know where the constituency is," he said.
"People in the constituency are not happy. They don’t want him. We need someone who knows the constituency and its problems."
Asked whether they would boycott Chiyangwa's candidature, the Zanu-PF activist said: "It’s too early to say. Let’s see how things play out.
"We are just waiting for the results of the primaries to be gazetted before making any pronouncements."
Earlier in the week, the Zanu-PF chairperson for Masvingo province Cde Ezra Chadzamira warned Chiyangwa against using his wealth to buy votes.
"We are warning Chiyangwa to stop abusing his resources to intimidate people into supporting him," he said.
"We cannot allow one person to take advantage of the situation by buying people's votes.
"That is not democracy and we will not tolerate such behaviour.
"There is no way Chiyangwa should be allowed to manipulate the electoral process through bribery or intimidation.

Maseko claimed Mutasa instructed his supporters to back Chiyangwa's candidature.

"People are saying they don't want Chiyangwa because he does not belong to this area.
"I am telling you, if Chiyangwa comes here, he will be rejected by the people."
Mutasa could not be reached for comment despite several attempts to contact him.
He reportedly declined to comment on the matter when approached by journalists at the Zanu-PF headquarters in Harare last week.
Another Zanu-PF activist, who requested anonymity for fear of jeopardising her political career, said there was growing resentment among party supporters in the constituency.
"There is no way Chiyangwa can win the coming elections.
"It will be difficult for him to campaign in the rural areas because he does not know anything about farming," she said.
"People in the rural areas want someone who knows their challenges.
"They do not want a person like Chiyangwa who lives in a big house and drives a Mercedes Benz.
"People in the rural areas are poor. They cannot afford luxuries such as cars and big houses.
"They need someone who can relate to them and understand their challenges.
"That is why Chiyangwa cannot win."
Chiyangwa was unreachable for comment yesterday.
But Zanu-PF spokesperson Simon Khaya Moyo defended Chiyangwa's chances of winning the forthcoming polls.
Khaya-Moyo said Chiyangwa would emerge victorious.
"I don't see any problem. I don't see any challenge.
"In fact, I believe Chiyangwa has a very bright future in politics," he said.
Khaya-Moyo said Chiyangwa had the backing of the majority of party supporters.
"He is the one who has been elected by the majority of the people in the constituency," he said.
"He is the one who has the confidence of the electorate."
Khaya-Moyo dismissed suggestions that Zanu-PF supporters were unhappy with Chiyangwa.
"I don't agree with that. I don't think that is correct," he said.
"I don't think that is a correct analysis of what is going on.
"What is happening is that people are expressing their right to freedom of association and freedom of expression.

Mutasa reportedly intervened in the disputes arising from the nomination of candidates.
Mutasa could not be reached for comment yesterday.
But his spokesperson, Jealousy Mawarire, rubbished the allegations saying they were baseless.
"I don't even know where you are getting your information from.
"It is not true at all," he said.
He said the Zanu-PF primary elections were free and fair.
"There was no interference whatsoever," he said.
"People voted according to their consciences without fear or favour.
"I am aware that there were complaints but we dealt with them accordingly.
"The primary elections went very well.
"They were free and fair.

Last year, the Zanu-PF national disciplinary committee suspended two members of the party's politburo - Jonathan Moyo and Saviour Kasukuwere - for "disrespectful behaviour".
Both were later reinstated by the Politburo.
Kasukuwere recently lost his Harare West seat to Tendai Biti.

"He was supposed to get at least one vote per delegate, which he failed to do.
"In my constituency there were more than 200 active delegates and he managed to get just two votes.
"Had I contested, I would have gotten more than that."
Ndebele said Chiyangwa was an unpopular figure in the constituency.
"He is not popular among the locals,'' he said.
"He is a stranger to the area. He does not even speak Shona.
"Even when he comes here, he uses his bodyguards as interpreters.
"This shows how little he cares about this constituency.
"People are not happy that he has become the Zanu-PF candidate.
"They feel betrayed because he promised them that he would work hard to develop the constituency once elected.

A Zanu-PF spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment yesterday.
Last month, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) postponed the primaries citing logistical challenges.
According to a statement issued by Zec chairperson Justice Priscilla Chigumba, the polls were postponed until further notice.
"Further to its earlier announcement, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) wishes to advise the nation that the forthcoming Primary Elections slated for 27th April 2018 have been postponed until further notice," part of the statement read.
"The commission regrets any inconvenience this may cause to the political parties, candidates and the electorate.
"This development is necessitated by the need to finalise preparations for the harmonised elections due to be held in July 2018.
"ZEC assures stakeholders that every effort will be made to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place to facilitate the holding of the primary elections at the soonest possible opportunity.
"Meanwhile, members of the public are urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious persons or behaviour to relevant law enforcement agencies.
"Police stations across the country are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week."

She also accused the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) boss Peter Mutasa of interfering in the internal party elections.
“We were told that if we don’t accept the results we would be expelled from the party,'' she said.
Another losing aspirant, Sibusiso Ndebele, also said Chiyangwa's victory was not legitimate.
"The primary elections were marred by irregularities,'' Ndebele said.
"There was no transparency whatsoever during the nomination process.
"People were intimidated into withdrawing their candidacies.
"I am still shocked that Chiyangwa emerged victorious.
"It was a clear case of manipulation."
He said Chiyangwa should have lost the primary elections.
"He should have been disqualified because he failed to meet the minimum requirement of 50% of the delegates' votes,'' he said.
"He was supposed to get at least one vote per delegate, which he failed to do.
"In my constituency there were more than 200 active delegates and he managed to get just two votes.
"Had I contested, I would have gotten more than that."
Ndebele said Chiyangwa was an unpopular figure in the constituency.
"He is not popular among the locals,'' he said.
"He is a stranger to the area. He does not even speak Shona.
"Even when he comes here, he uses his bodyguards as interpreters.
"This shows how little he cares about this constituency.
"People are not happy that he has become the Zanu-PF candidate.
"They feel betrayed because he promised them that he would work hard to develop the constituency once elected.
"That is why they want him to step down and let someone else take his place.
"People are now asking me to stand again so that we can remove him from the race.
"I am seriously considering standing again.
"I will consult my family before making a decision on whether to stand again or not.
"But I am sure that if I do, I will get a good result this time around," he said.
A Zanu-PF spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment yesterday.
Last month, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) postponed the primaries citing logistical challenges.
According to a statement issued by Zec chairperson Justice Priscilla Chigumba, the polls were postponed until further notice.
"Further to its earlier announcement, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) wishes to advise the nation that the forthcoming Primary Elections slated for 27th April 2018 have been postponed until further notice," part of the statement read.
"The commission regrets any inconvenience this may cause to the political parties, candidates and the electorate.
"This development is necessitated by the need to finalise preparations for the harmonised elections due to be held in July 2018.
"ZEC assures stakeholders that every effort will be made to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place to facilitate the holding of the primary elections at the soonest possible opportunity.
"Meanwhile, members of the public are urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious persons or behaviour to relevant law enforcement agencies.
"Police stations across the country are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week."

‘‘We were not given an opportunity to participate in the primary elections.
‘‘We were not even given a chance to campaign for ourselves.
‘‘This is what we call rigging," Dinha said.
Dinha said he had lost faith in Chiyangwa's ability to lead the party.
"I don't have confidence in him. I don't think he can lead this party," he said.
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) led by its secretary general Japhet Moyo, who is also the Zanu-PF youth league chairperson, has called for a probe into the primary elections.
In a statement, Moyo said: "We note with great concern the allegations of electoral fraud levelled against Honourable Phillip Chiyangwa by the losing candidates in the Zanu PF Zvimba South Constituency Parliamentary Primaries held on May 21, 2019."
"It is our view that the conduct of the Primary Elections should be probed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) in order to establish whether or not there is any evidence of foul play.
‘‘We urge the relevant authorities to take immediate action to ensure that the integrity of the electoral process is not compromised."
The opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) is also demanding an investigation into the primary elections.
Party spokesperson Jacob Mafume told NewZimbabwe.com that they were yet to receive a response from the electoral commission.
"We are yet to receive a response from the electoral commission regarding the allegations of electoral fraud levelled against Chiwenga,'' Mafume said.
"We are waiting for the commission to respond to our letter which was sent to them two weeks ago.
"We hope that the commission responds soon so that we

Dinha also accused Chiyangwa of using money to buy votes.
‘‘I don't know how much he spent but I can tell you that there was a lot of money spent on buying votes.
‘‘There was a lot of money spent on buying votes.
‘‘It was very expensive.

In an interview with NewsDay Weekender yesterday, provincial chairperson Lovemore Matuke dismissed the allegations.
"I am surprised by these claims. I don't know anything about this matter. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing like that," he said.
"There was a meeting held on Monday where we discussed the primary elections and everything was fine.
‘‘As far as I am concerned, all the processes were done in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec).

Dinha said the party should have held a national convention before holding primaries.
‘‘The party should have held a national convention before holding primaries. If they had done that, I am sure there would have been fewer problems.
"I don’t think there is any need to go back to the drawing board," he said.
A number of Zanu-PF youths in the area also accused Chiyangwa of rigging the primary elections, saying they were not allowed to voice their opinions.
"We were not allowed to express our views on him. We were not even given a chance to campaign against him," one youth said.

"I don't think there was any consultation with the people before they conducted the primaries. The whole process was marred by irregularities,” he said.
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) announced on June 28 that the results of the primaries would be released on June 29.
The commission however failed to deliver on its promise, announcing that the results were delayed due to technical glitches.
In a letter addressed to Zanu-PF provincial chairpersons, Zanu-PF national commissar Victor Matematanda said the delay was occasioned by a lack of information from the electoral body.
Matematanda said the delay was caused by the failure of ZEC officials to provide them with all the data required to carry out the verification exercise.
The commission later issued a statement apologising for the delays.
"The commission regrets to inform members of the public that due to unforeseen circumstances, the release of the provisional results of the primary elections held on 26th June 2018 has been postponed until further notice," reads part of the statement. — @okazunga

‘‘We were not given a chance to exercise our democratic rights," Dinha said.

‘‘This is unacceptable. We want to know how we are supposed to vote.''
In his victory speech at the party's headquarters in Bulawayo after winning the primary elections on May 26, the Zifa boss said: "The people have spoken loud and clear.
"I am humbled and honoured by the confidence you have placed in me. I promise to work tirelessly for the betterment of this country.

"I am grateful to God for giving me the opportunity to serve my people. This is just the beginning. The struggle continues."
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has called on the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) to nullify the results of the primary elections.
Addressing a press conference in Bulawayo, ZCTU secretary general Japhet Moyo accused the electoral body of failing to ensure free, fair and credible elections in the country.
"ZCTU calls on Zec to take immediate steps to nullify the primary elections held on May 26.
"It is obvious that the primary elections were not conducted according to the law and the Constitution," Moyo said.
"As ZCTU we believe that the primary elections should never have taken place in the first place.
‘‘The fact that they went ahead despite the Covid-19 pandemic speaks volumes about the state of affairs in the country.
‘‘We therefore call for the cancellation of the primary elections and the holding of fresh ones within the next two weeks.
"We also call for the setting up of an inquiry commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the primaries.
"We also call for the prosecution of anyone found guilty of rigging the primary elections," Moyo said.
He said ZCTU would mobilise its members across the country to protest against the primary elections if they were not nullified.

Dinha added: ‘‘I don't know why they didn't allow us to vote. I am sure if we had been allowed to vote, we would have voted for someone else.’’
In response, Chiyangwa dismissed the allegations as baseless.
‘‘It is unfortunate that some people are trying to tarnish my image by saying I rigged the primary elections. This is not true,'' he said.
‘‘There was nothing like rigging. There was just a misunderstanding on how the primaries should be conducted.''
Chiyangwa said he was confident of winning the elections.
‘‘I am very confident that I will win the elections. The people of Zvimba South are behind me,'' he said.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were marred by violence, ballot box snatching and voter intimidation.
At least five people were killed while several others were injured when police opened fire on opposition supporters who were protesting against alleged electoral malpractices. – News Day

2024-06-17 11:37:50,065:INFO: cast their votes during the primary elections.
He said this was despite the fact that they had been registered by the electoral commission.
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) had earlier announced that the primaries would be held on June 23.
The party had also set up a team of five provincial co-ordinating committee (PCC) members to monitor the primaries.
The PCCs, however, turned out to be mere observers and failed to carry out their duties effectively.
In a letter dated May 28, Zanu-PF national commissar Saviour Kasukuwere wrote to all provincial chairmen informing them of the rerun of the primary elections.
"I am writing to inform you that I have received a report from the district returning officer on the conduct of the primary elections conducted on the 22nd of June 2018. The report indicates that the primaries were held in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Electoral Act Chapter 2:13. As such, I hereby direct that we hold a rerun of the primaries within seven days of the receipt of the report," reads part of the letter.
The letter further states that those who participated in the primary elections will be required to present themselves at the district returning officer's office on or before Monday, June 25.
"Those who participated in the primary elections will be required to present themselves at the district returning officer's office on or before Monday, June 25, 2018 at 9am. Those who do not attend the meeting will be deemed to have withdrawn from the primaries," reads part of the letter which was seen by NewsDay Weekender.
The party has since suspended its secretary-general, Ignatius Chimedza, for failing to implement the directive.
This follows a similar move by Chiwenga, who suspended his deputy, Engelbert Rugeje, for failing to implement a directive issued by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
The two men have been at loggerheads for several months over succession politics.

‘‘We were not allowed to vote at all. We were told to go back home and wait for the results which never came,'' he said.
Dinha added: ‘‘I don't know why they didn't allow us to vote. I am sure if we had been allowed to vote, we would have voted for someone else.’’
In response, Chiyangwa dismissed the allegations as baseless.
‘‘It is unfortunate that some people are trying to tarnish my image by saying I rigged the primary elections. This is not true,'' he said.
‘‘There was nothing like rigging. There was just a misunderstanding on how the primaries should be conducted.''
Chiyangwa said he was confident of winning the elections.
‘‘I am very confident that I will win the elections. The people of Zvimba South are behind me,'' he said.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were marred by violence, ballot box snatching and voter intimidation.
At least five people were killed while several others were injured when police opened fire on opposition supporters who were protesting against alleged electoral malpractices. – News Day

"I don't see any reason why they should be allowed to vote for him," Dinha told The Straits Times.
‘‘This is what we want. We want to make sure that all members of the party get their fair share of the vote.''
‘‘We will continue to work with the government to ensure that all members of the party get their fair share of the vote.
"It's not just about politics, it's also about democracy,'' Dinha said.
The ZDF has been accused of rigging the results of the 2014 general election.
In a statement on its website, the group said: "Zimbabwean voters have made clear that they want a new constitution and a new political system which respects the rule of law and upholds the principles enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
"We are determined to build a new era of democratic governance based on the rule of law and respect for human rights.

He added: "They didn't know what was going on. They just wanted to get rid of him.''
The Zanu-PF leader has been accused of using his position to gain votes for himself.
He has denied any wrongdoing.
In a statement issued by his office late on Sunday, Chiyangwa said: "I am very proud of my achievements in this campaign. I want to thank all those who helped me achieve this goal. I also want to express my gratitude to all those who gave their time and energy to help me achieve this goal.

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his wealth to bribe delegates ahead of the primary election.
In an interview with NewZimbabwe.com this week, Zimbabwe Independent political analyst Rashweat Mukundu echoed similar sentiments.
“I am not saying Chiyangwa is corrupt. I just want to know where he got all the money he used to buy votes in the primary elections," he said.
He added: "There is nothing wrong with being rich. But you should not use your money to bribe others to do what they don’t want to do. This is a democratic country and we must elect leaders through free and fair elections."
Chiyangwa could not be reached for comment as he was reportedly attending a football match at the National Sports Stadium in Bulawayo.
His campaign team, however, rubbished claims that he had bribed his way into the party's ticket.
“It is unfortunate that people are now accusing Chiyangwa of bribing his way into Zanu PF primaries. These are malicious lies meant to tarnish the reputation of a hard-working and principled leader," spokesperson Tendai Biti said in a statement.
Biti said Chiyangwa's credentials were impeccable and he deserved to be the party's candidate.
“The truth of the matter is that he has been working tirelessly to improve the image of Zimbabwe internationally. He is one of the few Zimbabweans who have invested millions of dollars in Zimbabwe," he said.
Biti said Chiyangwa's opponents were simply jealous of his achievements and wanted to tarnish his name.
Chiyangwa is currently embroiled in a legal battle with soccer giants Manchester United over breach of contract.

She also accused Chiyangwa of using his wealth to buy votes during the primary elections.
‘‘I am not saying he bribed people, but I am saying he used his money to buy votes," she said.
‘‘People were told they would get $500 if they voted for Chiyangwa.
"It is unfortunate that we have a leader who does not know how to relate with ordinary people."
Another losing candidate, Tendai Ndlovu, echoed similar sentiments.
‘‘He (Chiyangwa) does not have the capacity to mobilise people.
"His popularity is only among the elite. He does not know how to relate with ordinary people," he said.
Ndlovu said Chiyangwa had failed to address issues affecting Zimbabweans such as high unemployment and poor service delivery.
‘‘We need a leader who understands the challenges faced by ordinary people," he said.
The Zanu-PF primary elections were marred by violence, intimidation and irregularities which led to the ruling party ordering a re-run of the polls.
A total of 12 candidates contested the primary elections in Zvimba South constituency.
In the first round of polling, Chiyangwa garnered 1 689 votes while his closest rival, retired brigadier-general Ambrose Mutinhiri, got 1 578 votes.
The ruling party ordered a re-run of the primary elections after complaints of malpractices were raised.
During the re-run, Chiyangwa received 1 700 votes while Mutinhiri got 1 699 votes.
The Zanu-PF national executive committee then ordered a run-off between Chiyangwa and Mutinhiri.
Chiyangwa emerged victorious in the second round of polling after receiving 1 700 votes against Mutinhiri's 1 699 votes.

Another disgruntled Zanu PF supporter from Ward 18, who preferred anonymity, said: "It's very unfortunate that Chiyangwa got away with rigging the primary elections. We need a leader who can unite the party.''
However, Chiyangwa dismissed the claims saying they were aimed at tarnish his image.
“Those who are crying foul are those who lost the primaries,” he said when contacted for comment. “They are trying to discredit me. They want to use this issue to damage my reputation.”
A senior party official, who declined to be named, told The Herald on Sunday that Zanu PF would not tolerate such behaviour and would act accordingly.
“We will deal with any person who tries to interfere with the electoral processes. We are not going to allow anyone to interfere with the electoral processes. We will take decisive action against anyone who does so,’’ said another Zanu-PF official.
Zanu-PF national spokesperson Simon Khaya Moyo also denied allegations of rigging the primaries.
“There was no interference with the elections. The results were announced within the shortest possible time. This shows the transparency and credibility of the elections. The results were also verified by the Zimbabwe Election Commission and the Electoral Supervisory Commission.
