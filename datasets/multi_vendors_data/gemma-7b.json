        "Published: Dec. 27, 2014 at 01:59 p.m.\nUpdated: Dec. 27, 2014 at 08:15 p.m.\nJosh Gordon's bizarre year took one more sideways turn before the calendar flipped to 2015.\nThe Cleveland Browns announced Saturday that they suspended Josh Gordon for Week 17 for violation of team rules.\nNFL Media columnist Michael Sliver reported that Gordon and quarterback Johnny Manziel (who's on injured reserve) were both absent from the Browns walkthrough Saturday. NFL Media's Albert Breer confirmed the receiver's absence was the cause of the suspension, per a source briefed on the situation.\nGordon was suspended for 10 games earlier this year for violating the league's substance-abuse policy.\nAs Breer notes, Gordon missing his 11th game will keep the wideout from accruing a season toward free agency -- players must play in six games to earn a year of eligibility toward becoming a free agent.\nWhether or not the Browns pay Josh Gordon for Sunday's game will determine whether he accrues the year. Gordon can appeal with the NFLPA.\nUpon his return, Gordon didn't look close to the player that led the league in receiving in 2013. Criticized for being out of shape and not on the same page with his quarterbacks, Gordon compiled just 24 receptions for 303 yards and zero touchdowns in his five games this season.\nWith rookie Connor Shaw starting against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, the Browns will be hindered without Gordon as a security blanket for the young signal-caller as Cleveland tries to earn its first a non-losing season since 2007.\nThe suspension generates questions about Gordon's future in Cleveland in 2015. The previous administration considered trading the troubled receiver prior to the 2013 season. Now, after a lost season, there is a chance the new one might consider moving on from the gifted but misguided wideout.\nAs for Johnny Football, NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Manziel was fined for being late to medical treatment, per a Browns source. Since the rookie is on IR, he was not required to attend the walkthrough.\nReceiver Phil Bates has been added to the Browns' roster to fill Gordon's spot for Sunday, but he's since been ruled out.",
        "Tottenham's decision to play two overseas friendlies just days before the Premier League season was \"extraordinary\" - according to a former top-flight fitness coach.\nSpurs faced Real Madrid on Tuesday and AC Milan on Wednesday, in Germany, arriving back in London on Thursday.\nThey play Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday at 12:45 BST.\nEx-Liverpool fitness coach Darren Burgess also said long-haul pre-seasons \"risk soft-tissue injury and fatigue\".\nSpurs also played in the US during the summer, losing 2-1 to MLS All-Stars on 30 July.\n\"The last week coming into the season should very much be a taper week where you bring the training volume down but keep the intensity,\" Burgess said.\n\"But it's hard for the players because they are naturally competitive and in that last game they will want to try and win a spot in the team.\"\nThe Australian added: \"If you get off to a flying start to the season, it's so important in avoiding relegation or winning the league. By October or November, what you do in pre-season becomes largely irrelevant, because you get fitness from the games.\"\nManchester City and Liverpool have both played in Australia and Asia, while Arsenal visited Singapore and Chelsea and Manchester United visited the United States.\nCity midfielder Fabian Delph suffered a hamstring injury in Australia in July while Liverpool's Joe Allen also suffered a similar muscle problem after returning from Liverpool's pre-season tour, which also included Helsinki.\nBurgess, who now works for AFL team Port Adelaide, believes teams travelling shorter distances will be in better condition for the new campaign.\n\"I did three pre-seasons at Liverpool [in 2010-2012] where we went to Switzerland for the first season, Asia in the second and America in the third,\" said Burgess.\n\"There is no doubt that from a freshness point of view, staying in Europe gave our players an advantage.\nWhen did clubs last play overseas?\nChampions Chelsea played their last pre-season game in the United States on 29 July, four days before they were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal in the Community Shield.\nJose Mourinho's team face Swansea at home on Sunday with Gary Monk's side limiting their warm-up games to Germany and England.\nLiverpool are away at Stoke the same day with the Potters arriving home from pre-season games in Asia earlier than Brendan Rodgers' team.\nManchester City, who travel to West Brom on Monday, returned to England on 29 July from Vietnam, 10 days after the Baggies played their last overseas game. Manuel Pellegrini's side also spent in Germany last weekend, facing Stuttgart.\nManchester United's last overseas pre-season match was in Chicago on 30 July.",
        "MONKLANDS is this week celebrating a much-needed jobs boost.\nThe site of the former MSD/Organon research facility in Chapelhall will be transformed into a dedicated base for bioscience, pharmaceutical, and healthcare companies, creating hundreds of new jobs.\nAnd John Swinney, the cabinet secretary for finance, employment and sustainable growth will make the announcement at the Bo\u2019ness Road site today (Wednesday).\nThe joint venture between BioCity Nottingham and Roslin BioCentre has been enabled by the gifting of the site to BioCity Scotland by former occupants MSD (operating in the US and Canada as Merck & Co).\nThe agreement unlocks over 130,000 square feet of purpose-built laboratories and offices on the 23-acre site to support pre-clinical drug discovery and development by a range of companies.\nThere are also administrative and conference facilities.\nAirdrie & Shotts SNP MSP Alex Neil told the Advertiser it was \u201ca fantastic start to 2012 for Airdrie\u201d.\nPredicting that the new project will create hundreds of well-paid new jobs for the area, Mr Neil said the Scottish Government has been working for a year with BioCity Nottingham to help ensure this project came to the site vacated when MSD closed in 2010.\nHe added: \u201cI am absolutely delighted with this announcement. A Phoenix has arisen from the ashes of MSD and done so in a spectacular way.\n\u201cThe jobs and investment this project brings are not just high in number but brilliant in quality.\n\u201cIt is especially welcome that the diversity of companies which will operate from this site means that we won\u2019t be dependent on just one big employer.\n\u201cHaving numerous firms operating from this site, many of which will be high-growth businesses, will help make these jobs more secure.\n\u201cThey will provide a springboard from which many of them will grow to become big businesses.\nIn addition to over 130,000 sq ft of pharma-quality fully-fitted laboratory and office space, BioCity Scotland will provide access to a wide range of state-of-the-art equipment available to rent.",
        "Their duet, off Shakira's March album release, premiered Monday (January 12).\nBad boy alert! Shakira and Rihanna have fallen hard for the wrong guy on their duet, \"Can't Remember To Forget You,\" which debuted on Monday (January 13).\nThe up-tempo single has Latin and Island flourishes that slightly recall Bruno Mars' \"Locked Out Of Heaven\". Thematically, it pays homage to Shakira's 2007 duet with Beyonc\u00e9 \"Beautiful Liar.\"\nThe trade lines about a guy they just can't let go. \"Oh oh oh oh/ I can't remember to forget you/ I keep forgetting I should let you go/ But when you look at me, the only memory, is us kissing in the moonlight/ Oh oh oh oh/ I can't remember to forget you,\" they each sing on the chorus.\nSo, how deep do Shakira and Rihanna's feelings for this guy run? They break it down later on in the song, singing, \"I rob and I kill to keep him with me/ I do anything for that boy/ I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight/ I do anything for that boy.\"\nThe song will be featured on Shakira's upcoming album, the follow-up to 2010's Sale el Sol. The Colombian-born pop star also announced Monday that the album will drop March 25.\nShakira explained the duet after debuting the track on Ryan Seacrest's radio show.\n\"You know, we're both from the Caribbean so I always thought we had that common ground, but this song is pretty reggae,\" noting it has a rock sound that she feels Rihanna also embodied. \"I honestly thought it would never happen... She heard the record and she loved it and she said she was onboard and I was the happiest girl alive,\" she said. \"To shoot the video with her has been a blast.\"\nSo, what inspired the track? Well, not Shakira's relationship with her baby daddy, Spanish soccer player Gerard Pique. \"I'm going through a completely different experience right in relation to the song. The song is about that guy that just gets under your skin and you can't leave alone. I think every woman has been through that. This song is not exactly a reflection of my personal life right now,\" she said, calling from Barcelona where she putting the finishing touches on the album.\nIn addition to new music, she will return to \"The Voice\" on February 24 with guest mentor Miranda Lambert joining her team. \"I don't know [how Blake Shelton feels]. I don't care much,\" she teased. \"I'm excited to come back. I have this strategy designed only to take him down.\"",
        "The Dynaudio Emit M10 is a dream speaker for audiophiles with small rooms.\nI've always had a thing for high-performance speakers that come alive in small rooms. The best ones are invariably small, and the Dynaudio Emit M10 monitor ($799, \u00a3499, AU$1,099 per pair) definitely qualifies as tiny, it measures a mere 6.7 by 11.5 by 9.5 inches (170 by 292 by 240 mm), and it's offered in black or white satin lacquer finishes.\nThis pint-size Dynaudio sports a 1-inch (28 mm) soft dome tweeter, and a 6-inch (140mm) magnesium silicate polymer midrange/woofer. The speaker has a small bass port on its rear end, and impedance is listed at 6 ohms. The Emit M10 is the baby of the Emit line, moving up from there you get the larger Emit M20 bookshelf, Emit M30 tower and the Emit M15 C center channel speaker for home-theater applications. The speakers all come with grilles.\nI heard the Emit M10 at the In Living Stereo store in New York City, and I have owned and auditioned many Dynaudio speakers dating back 15 years, but even so the Emit M10's sound wasn't exactly what I expected. It was really nice, but more alive and exciting than the sweet house sound I associate with Dynaudio.\nThe Emit M10s unfurled a wall-to-wall soundstage with great depth as I played Brian Eno's new album, \"The Ship.\" The first track is a rambling, ambient trip, with a churning low bass foundation that I could hardly believe was coming from speakers as small as these. I was so totally sucked into Eno's slow-motion vortex of sound and texture that I forgot that I was listening to the Emit M10s; I was lost in the music.\nI also played Nap Eyes' spicy \"Thought Rock Fish Scale\" album to see how the Emit M10s handled rock, which they did with aplomb. It's hardly head-banger music, but Nap Eyes recorded these tunes to four-track tape without overdubs, and even before I knew about that, I heard the music had a refreshingly direct, less-processed and live sound than most rock albums. Nap Eyes' crazy rhythms and Nigel Chapman's vocals were right there, firmly planted between the two Emit M10s. Chapman sounds like Lou Reed at times, and the band has a Velvet Underground vibe, but there's nothing overtly retro about Nap Eyes music I can put my finger on.\nMy brief encounter with the Dynaudio Emit M10 left me with a respect for its abilities, and I expect to review more Dynaudio speakers later this year.",
        "Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that Gov. Andrew Cuomo's decision to withhold federal Disproportionate Share Hospital payments from the city public hospital system \"makes no sense.\"\n\"This is not normal and there is no excuse for it,\" de Blasio said during an unrelated press conference in Manhattan.\nIt was the first time de Blasio publicly commented on the latest spat between the city and state, one the mayor said could \"undermine health care in this city.\"\nThe federal Medicaid DSH payments are provided to hospitals that treat the uninsured and underinsured. NYC Health + Hospitals CEO Stan Brezenoff sent a letter to the state last week demanding the Cuomo administration turn over $380 million he feels his system is owed. Half of that is city dollars which draw down the federal share.\nThe Cuomo administration has noted that the state is facing a $329 million cut to the DSH program in the current fiscal year and the prudent action is to hold on to last year's cash until a plan to address future shortfalls is agreed upon.\nDe Blasio found that absurd.\n\"For the governor somehow to say New York City hospitals should suffer in the meantime makes no sense,\" de Blasio said. \"I think a lot of New Yorkers would be upset by that. Here is my advice to the governor ... give our public hospitals the resources they have coming to them and don\u2019t turn this into a political football.\"\nRobert Mujica, director of the state budget division, said in a statement that the federal government cut the state\u2019s public hospital funding by $2.8 billion over several years.\n\"This will require hospitals across New York to find efficiencies and the sponsoring governments and institutions to offer assistance. We have provided the hospitals with as much funding as possible while being responsible \u2014 including $55 million to HHC just this past Friday,\" Mujica said. \"There is no set payment schedule for this federal aid and obviously, the current reimbursement rate is not sustainable. As a result, the existing federal funds must now be managed into next year.\"\nMujica said 25 public hospitals will be immediately affected and \"it\u2019s not possible for one hospital to take the position that they should be immune.\"\nCuomo is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2 p.m.",
        "Proponents of a downtown trolley system cannot depend on a state gas tax increase for funding, and private business must shoulder a bigger share of the cost of construction, according to the chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority.\nMoreover, RTA chief Gayle Franzen said that if the system goes forward, it should be built all at once instead of in two phases. That would mean finding money at the outset to cover the entire $560 million cost, rather than the $320 million estimated for the first phase.\nA committee of business, government and civic leaders is proposing construction of the system to speed commuters, shoppers and tourists through a downtown area that has grown dramatically beyond the boundaries of the Loop.\nThe committee, funded by RTA grants and working under the auspices of the Metropolitan Planning Council, has produced a proposal to cover the cost of the system equally from three sources: a federal program for new transit lines, revenue from property owners in a special taxing district served by the system and an increase in the state gas tax.\nBut Franzen said funds generated by a proposed program that includes a 6- cent-a-gallon increase in the state`s fuel tax should go only for highway improvements and repairs and repairs to the existing transit infrastructure.\nThe increased gas levy was proposed last week by Illinois Transportation Secretary Gregory Baise. Under his plan, $3.7 billion would be generated over the next five years for highway upgrading, and the RTA would receive about $1.2 billion to replace aging buses and rail cars and to shore up and replace crumbling elevated structures, track and maintenance facilities.\nFranzen called on property owners served by the system to produce enough cash to match federal funds.\n''Without private money in the downtown area making a strong, strong financial commitment, the circulator system cannot fly,'' he said.\nState transportation officials believe the trolley supporters are too optimistic about their ability to get dwindling federal dollars for the project. If this assessment is correct, another source of funding must be found or the private sector would have to cover even more of the system`s cost.\nAs proposed, the first phase of the system would be built from about Canal Street east on Monroe Street to Columbus Drive, north on Columbus and Fairbanks Court to Chicago Avenue and then east to State Street.\nA second leg would run roughly along Canal Street north from about Monroe, past Union and Chicago & North Western Stations and across the Chicago River. It then would run east along the river bank, across Fairbanks Court to about Lake Shore Drive.\nThe second phase would extend the system south to the lakefront museums and McCormick Place, west to sports stadiums and the West Side complex of medical facilities and north and south through the Loop, connecting the River North area and the South Loop.",
        "This weekend's report that Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner attended a meeting at Trump Tower last June with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton was another drip in the ever-expanding Russia story \u2014 and it led to Trump Jr. lawyering up for the Russia probe last night.\nLooks like he needed it: The story exploded this afternoon when Trump Jr. tweeted the full email chain that led to the meeting, which explicitly called the meeting a \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\nGo deeper: From Rob Goldstone to the Agalarovs, the news surrounding this meeting has introduced a whole host of colorful new characters to the Trump-Russia web, many of whom hadn't been mentioned widely in previous reports.\nVeselnitskaya is known for her lobbying against the Magnitsky Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2012 and designed to seize the assets of and deny visas to suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law so enraged Russian President Vladimir Putin that he halted the adoption of Russian children by American families. Veselnitskaya told the NYT that she \"never acted on behalf of the Russian government,\" but her anti-Magnitsky campaign is obviously a cause that's deeply personal for Putin.\nGoldstone is a friend of Trump Jr., often involved in the Miss Universe pageant, who claimed to set up the meeting for Veselnitskaya to discuss the adoption issues caused by the Magnitsky Act, per a WaPo report. His social media pages show him interacting with President Trump as far back as 2013 \u2014 and include an Instagram of him wearing a shirt that simply says \"Russia\" just after Trump won the presidency in November.\nAgalarov is a 37-year-old pop star who became close to Trump following the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. Emin has performed at Trump golf courses, received a videotaped birthday message from Trump in 2013, and even got Trump to cameo in one of his music videos, per Forbes' definitive Agalarov profile. He reportedly exchanged text messages with Trump Jr. around the inauguration, inquiring about the potential for new business deals.\nAccording to Forbes, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant ended up in the Moscow \u2014 hosted at one of the Agalarovs' properties \u2014 after Aras and Emin made a concerted effort to reach out to Trump. Aras' bigger goal was a licensing deal with Trump to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, which Emin told Forbes was in the pipeline before Trump announced his campaign, putting the deal on ice.",
        "The 'Washington Post' ran a piece last week headlined \"Russian propaganda effort helped spread 'fake news' during election, experts say.\"\nLast week, a technology reporter for the Washington Post named Craig Timberg ran an incredible story. It has no analog that I can think of in modern times. Headlined \u201cRussian propaganda effort helped spread \u2018fake news\u2019 during election, experts say,\u201d the piece promotes the work of a shadowy group that smears some 200 alternative news outlets as either knowing or unwitting agents of a foreign power, including popular sites like Truthdig and Naked Capitalism.\nThe piece relied on what it claimed were \u201ctwo teams of independent researchers,\u201d but the citing of a report by the longtime anticommunist Foreign Policy Research Institute was really window dressing.\nThe meat of the story relied on a report by unnamed analysts from a single mysterious \u201corganization\u201d called PropOrNot \u2013 we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s one person or, as it claims, over 30 \u2013 a \u201cgroup\u201d that seems to have been in existence for just a few months.\nIt was PropOrNot\u2019s report that identified what it calls \u201cthe list\u201d of 200 offending sites. Outlets as diverse as AntiWar.com, LewRockwell.com and the Ron Paul Institute were described as either knowingly directed by Russian intelligence, or \u201cuseful idiots\u201d who unwittingly did the bidding of foreign masters.\n\u201cAwww, wook at all the angwy Putinists, trying to change the subject \u2013 they\u2019re so vewwy angwy!!\u201d it wrote on Saturday.\n\u201cFascists. Straight up muthafuckin\u2019 fascists. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against,\u201d it wrote last Tuesday, two days before Timberg\u2019s report.\nAny halfway decent editor would have been scared to death by any of these factors. Moreover the vast majority of reporters would have needed to see something a lot more concrete than a half-assed theoretical paper from such a dicey source before denouncing 200 news organizations as traitors.\nBut if that same source also demanded anonymity on the preposterous grounds that it feared being \u201ctargeted by Russia\u2019s legions of skilled hackers\u201d? Any sane reporter would have booted them out the door. You want to blacklist hundreds of people, but you won\u2019t put your name to your claims? Take a hike.\nYet the Post thought otherwise, and its report was uncritically picked up by other outlets like USA Today and the Daily Beast. The \u201cRussians did it\u201d story was greedily devoured by a growing segment of blue-state America that is beginning to fall victim to the same conspiracist tendencies that became epidemic on the political right in the last few years.\nThe right-wing fascination with conspiracy has culminated in a situation where someone like Alex Jones of Infowars (who believes juice boxes make frogs gay) is considered a news source. Jones is believed even by our new president-elect, who just repeated one of his outrageous reports, to the effect that three million undocumented immigrants voted in the November 8th election.\nThat Jones report was based on a tweet by someone named Greg Phillips of an organization called VoteStand.\n\u201cThey\u201d never called The Intercept back.\nMost high school papers wouldn\u2019t touch sources like these. But in November 2016, both the president-elect of the United States and the Washington Post are equally at ease with this sort of sourcing.\nAll of this is an outgrowth of this horrible election season we just lived through.\nA lot of reporters over the summer were so scared by the prospect of a Trump presidency that they talked \u2013 in some cases publicly \u2013 about abandoning traditional ideas about journalistic \u201cdistance\u201d from politicians, in favor of open advocacy for the Clinton campaign. \u201cTrump is testing the norms of objectivity in journalism,\u201d is how The Times put it.\nThese journalists seemed totally indifferent to the Pandora\u2019s box they were opening. They didn\u2019t understand that most politicians have no use for critical media. Many of them don\u2019t see alternative points of view as healthy or even legitimate. If you polled a hundred politicians about the profession, 99 would say that all reporters are obstructionist scum whose removal from the planet would be a boon to society.\nThe only time politicians like the media is when we\u2019re helping them get elected or push through certain policies, like for instance helping spread dubious stories about Iraq\u2019s WMD capability. Otherwise, they despise us. So news outlets that get into bed with politicians are usually making a devil\u2019s bargain they don\u2019t fully understand.\nThey may think they\u2019re being patriotic (as many did during the Iraq/WMD episode), but in the end what will happen is that they will adopt the point of view of their political sponsors. They will soon enough denounce other reporters and begin to see themselves as part of the power structure, as opposed to a check on it.\nThis is the ultimate in stupidity and self-annihilating behavior. The power of the press comes from its independence from politicians. Jump into bed with them and you not only won\u2019t ever be able to get out, but you\u2019ll win nothing but a loss of real influence and the undying loathing of audiences.\nHelping Beltway politicos mass-label a huge portion of dissenting media as \u201cuseful idiots\u201d for foreign enemies in this sense is an extraordinarily self-destructive act. Maybe the Post doesn\u2019t care and thinks it\u2019s doing the right thing. In that case, at least do the damn work.",
        "End of Muslim Brotherhood Rule in Egypt? Or Civil War?\nEgypt is teetering on the brink of becoming Libya. Or Syria.\nTwo years after the revolt that toppled Hosni Mubarak, Egypt is teetering on the edge of an explosion.\nPresident Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood stand-in who was elected president a year ago, has now defied the military\u2019s forty-eight-hour ultimatum that he give in to the demands of protesters, millions of whom have streamed into the streets. Despite growing international pressure, the resignations of most of the non\u2013Muslim Brotherhood ministers of his government\u2014including the foreign minister\u2014and spreading protests, Morsi seems willing to call the army\u2019s bluff. We\u2019ll find out in the next day or so if the army is bluffing.\nAnd the Muslim Brotherhood, which has a long history of paramilitary activity, is building its own defense force in preparation for what could become a civil war.\nAs the night wore on, Morsi\u2019s position seemed ever more untenable, with the Ministry of the Interior announcing its \u201ccomplete solidarity\u201d with Egypt\u2019s armed forces, and the army taking control of local government headquarters in Fayoum, a governorship south of Cairo.\nPresident Obama has called Morsi, from Tanzania, to urge him to listen to the protesters. General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called General Sisi, the Egyptian defense minister and spokesman for the military council\u2014although there\u2019s no word on what Dempsey said. The United Nations\u2019 top human rights official, Navi Pillay, has also urged Morsi to make a deal.\nBut after two days of massive protests against Morsi, [the Salafist Call] endorsed the opposition\u2019s main demand (early presidential elections), and also called for a government of technocrats and a committee for constitutional amendments.\nElBaradei will also be mediating between state institutions and all political forces to draw a map for political transition.\nThe coalition that backed Sunday\u2019s protests said there was no question of negotiating now with Morsi on the general\u2019s timetable and it was already formulating positions for discussion directly with the army once the 48 hours are up.\nMursi\u2019s military adviser, U.S.-trained former chief-of-staff General Sami Enan, also resigned.\n\u201cThe Egyptian people have spoken and as a result everyone must listen and implement, especially since this unprecedented (protest) was accompanied by the fall of some martyrs which is unacceptable because Egyptian blood is valued highly and must be preserved,\u201d Enan told Al Arabiya television.\nEl-Watan quoted senior General Adel El-Mursi as saying that if there were no agreement among political leaders to hold early presidential elections, the alternative could involve \u201ca return to revolutionary legitimacy\u201d.\nUnder that scenario, the sole functioning chamber of parliament, the Islamist-dominated Shura Council, would be dissolved, the Islamist-tinged constitution enacted under Mursi would be scrapped, and a presidential council would rule by decree until fresh elections could be held under new rules, he was quoted as saying. That is largely the opposition position.\nSharif Abdel Kouddous writes about why, one year after Morsi\u2019s election, Egyptians are now demanding his resignation.",
        "Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze shows no sign of easingwith new figures showing that prices are still rising faster than wages.\nWhat is inflation and why does it matter?\nInflation is when prices rise. Deflation is the opposite \u2013 price decreases over time \u2013 but inflation is far more common.\nIf inflation is 10%, then a \u00a350 pair of shoes will cost \u00a355 in a year's time and \u00a360.50 a year after that.\nInflation eats away at the value of wages and savings \u2013 if you earn 10% on your savings but inflation is 10%, the real rate of interest on your pot is actually 0%.\nA relatively new phenomenon, inflation has become a real worry for governments since the 1960s.\nAs a rule of thumb, times of high inflation are good for borrowers and bad for investors.\nMortgages are a good example of how borrowing can be advantageous \u2013 annual inflation of 10% over seven years halves the real value of a mortgage.\nOn the other hand, pensioners, who depend on a fixed income, watch the value of their assets erode.\nThe government's preferred measure of inflation, and the one the Bank of England takes into account when setting interest rates, is the consumer price index (CPI).\nThe retail prices index (RPI) is often used in wage negotiations.\nThe consumer prices index, due on Tuesday, is expected to rise to 2.8% for August, up from 2.6% in July, and close to the four-year high of 2.9% reached in June.\nTransport costs are likely to be one of the main drivers of higher inflation, as petrol and diesel have become more expensive in recent weeks.\nWages, though, are not keeping pace. City economists predict that Wednesday\u2019s labour market statistics will show that average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.2% per year in the three months to July. This would be an improvement on the 2.1% recorded a month ago, but still means that real wages are falling.\nAnalysts at Investec predict the UK unemployment rate could drop to 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. But they caution that there are still no sign that wage growth is taking off.\nBusiness advisers BDO have warned that the rise in employment has not yet delivered higher productivity either.\nPeter Hemington, a partner at BDO, explained: \u201cUK employment law is sufficiently elastic to give employers the comfort that they can flex workforces quickly as market conditions change.\nUnion leaders will renew their calls for the government to lift the 1% pay cap on public sector workers, when they gather for the Trades Union Congress in Brighton.\nThe Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, said Theresa May\u2019s administration was \u201cout of step\u201d with the national mood.\n\u201cAfter seven long years of pay freezes and limits on their wages, ambulance workers, school meals staff, police and community support officers and other public service employees all deserve so much better,\u201d Prentis said.",
        "My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome \u2014 and yet each is \u201creading\u201d a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development. An increasing body of data suggests this is accomplished by modifying the genome both in the nature of the proteins bound to different sequences and in the spatial organization of those sequences relative to each other. The spatial organization or folding of the genome may be particularly important in complex multicellular organisms, since many of the sequences known to interact based on genetic data are nonetheless substantially separated from each other along the linear genome. By regulating the folding of this linear sequence into a higher order structure, a cell might change which regulatory sequences have access to which genes, and achieve different behavioral states.\nSo far we have little imaging data on how the genome is folded within a cell on the length scale of individual genes, or whether this folding is regulated in any way relevant to the behavior of the cell. Our limited knowledge stems largely from want of a method that has both the resolution and specificity to visualize such genomic substructure. Conventional fluorescent microscopy has developed excellent tools for coloring specific regions of DNA and particular DNA-associated proteins with uniquely colored dyes \u2014 but lacks the resolution to turn these colored blurs into structures. Electron-microscopy has substantially greater resolution but lacks compatibility with specific labeling techniques to tell different gene clusters or different protein types apart. Super-resolution imaging approaches promise to address this balance by allowing the use of fluorescent labels while simultaneously resolving structures on the nano-scale. I have been adapting this approach to uncover the nano-scale structure of chromatin and determine to how this structure changes when bound by different types of nuclear proteins. While individual gene clusters appear as quite diverse structures, there appear to be a few general features, for example, linking structure with the epigenetic state.\nOligoSTORM and OligoDNA-PAINT meld the Oligopaint technology for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with, respectively, Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) and DNA-based Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (DNA-PAINT) to enable in situ single-molecule super-resolution imaging of nucleic acids. Both strategies enable \u226420 nm resolution and are appropriate for imaging nanoscale features of the genomes of a wide range of species, including human, mouse, and fruit fly (Drosophila).",
        "A Staten Island mom is suing the city after NYPD officers allegedly entered her St. George home without a warrant, beat her family, and killed her parakeet last year.\nST. GEORGE \u2014 A Staten Island woman has sued the city claiming police entered her St. George home without a warrant, beat her family and killed her beloved pet parakeet, according to court documents.\nLast year, Evelyn Lugo's bird, Tito, was thrown from his cage after it was knocked off a dresser as cops came into her Corson Avenue home, the Daily News first reported.\nThe officers then stepped on the bird intentionally, killing it, court documents say.\nOfficers also beat two of Lugo's sons, her daughter and a family friend, the lawsuit claims.\nAccording to court documents, police entered Lugo's home on Sept. 2, 2012, as her family was celebrating Labor Day.\nPolice stopped and questioned her son Edwin Avellanet as he was outside throwing out garbage and asked for identification, the lawsuit says. When he refused to show any, officers allegedly grabbed his right arm and Avellanet broke free and ran into the building.\nOfficers broke windows of the home, and when Lugo opened the front door she was thrown outside by police, court papers say.\nWhen inside, police allegedly struck Avellanet two or three times with a hard object, struck their friend in the face and threw a woman into the dresser with the bird cage on it, court documents say.\nPolice then allegedly pepper sprayed Lugo's daughter and son, according to the documents.\nLugo's son, daughter and family friend were arrested and all three were taken to Staten Island University Hospital in custody.\nThey were treated for multiple facial lacerations and lacerations to the head. Lugo's daughter was also treated for an asthma attack, the court papers say.\nAll charges were eventually dropped and sealed by Richmond County Supreme Court, the lawsuit says.\nLugo could not be reached for comment on the story.\nThe city's Law Department did not say why police entered the home last year, or what charges were lodged against the family, but said they're reviewing the case.\n\"We will review the allegations in the complaint, which at this point are merely allegations,\" a spokeswoman for the department said.",
        "Durian stinks so badly that it\u2019s banned from hotels and mass transit in parts of Southeast Asia, yet it\u2019s regarded by some as a delicacy.\nWhen my friend Bob Halliday thinks about durians, the tropical fruit that some say smells like garbage, he not only salivates with delighted anticipation, but he also \u201cfoams like a geyser.\u201d Those were the words he used on the eve of our visit to an orchard north of Bangkok that was filled with these green spiky fruits dangling dangerously from towering trees.\nI confess to the same passion with what must be the world\u2019s smelliest fruit.\nWhat is it about the durian? Shaped like a rugby ball with large thorns that can pierce even the most callused hands, durian stinks so badly that it\u2019s banned from airplanes, hotels and mass transit in most Southeast Asian cities. In a part of the world where rules are constantly bent and broken, carrying a durian into confined spaces is not taken lightly, punishable by scowls or eviction.\nYet aficionados like Bob and me will travel terrible distances, cancel important appointments \u2014 do anything \u2014 to scarf down globs of custardy flesh from a durian. While many Thais like their durians harvested early so the interior is still hard and can be neatly handled, I like an over-ripened durian, which has the consistency of cottage cheese. It\u2019s a very messy affair.\nThere is a long tradition of durian haters who cannot get past the smell and gooey-ness of durian, especially among Western visitors to Southeast Asia. Simon de La Loub\u00e8re, a French diplomat who came here in the 17th century and wrote with unusual empathy about the Kingdom of Siam, drew the line at durian, describing it as \u201cunbearable\u201d because of its smell.\nBut as a foreign correspondent for nearly two decades who has always sought to write fairly and dispassionately, I dispense with objectivity for a moment and attempt an ode to what the Malaysians rightly call the king of fruits.\nYes, I freely admit that when ripe it can smell like a dead animal. Yes, the fruit is difficult to handle, bearing likeness to a medieval weapon. But get down to the pale yellow, creamy flesh, and you\u2019ll experience overtones of hazelnut, apricot, caramelized banana and egg custard. That\u2019s my attempt at describing durian. But words fail; there is no other fruit like it. Bob compares it to the works of Olivier Messiaen, the 20th-century French composer: complex, dissonant, but with an overall impression of sweetness.\nThe first time I tasted durian was when I was posted in Kuala Lumpur 15 years ago. Trucks piled high with the fruit would come in from the Malaysian countryside, and I would spend evenings sitting with friends on plastic stools by the roadside sampling different varieties. Unlike the Thais, who cut durians down from trees, Malaysians usually wait for them to fall. The result is a much riper and stronger-tasting durian, sometimes slightly fermented. Durian farmers in Malaysia have been known to wear helmets: No one wants to be on the receiving end of a five-pound spike-bomb. Malaysians also believe that durian is an aphrodisiac. When the durians fall, the sarongs go up, goes a Malaysian saying.\nWe live in a time when chemists and cooks have joined hands to concoct foods of unrivaled complexity in everything from packaged snack food to wallet-crushing meals at Michelin-starred restaurants.\nWhat I love about durians is that there is no laboratory needed to achieve the depth and range of tastes they offer. It\u2019s one of nature\u2019s masterpieces, dangling tantalizingly in the jungle. Durians, even those harvested from the same branch, can be so nuanced and dissimilar that tasting them is something akin to sampling fine wine.\nBob, one of the foremost experts on the food of Thailand who has written restaurant reviews there for decades, said that durian reminds him of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u201cIt tastes like something that was prepared in a kitchen, not grown on a tree,\u201d he said after sampling a particularly delightful durian.\nDurian season starts in May and tapers off around November in Thailand, depending on the latitude. But these days orchard owners have managed to coax the fruit from trees year round. They are prized by the Thai elite, who offer gan yao durians, a delectable variety with a long stem, as gifts to business partners or senior government officials. (Yes, a durian bribe.) One fruit can easily sell for $50.\nDurians also grow in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia. In Malaysia the season extends until around the end of the year.\nBob and I recently traveled to three places around Bangkok to sample durian: a high-end Bangkok fruit market; roadside stalls in Chinatown, where durian lovers can get their fix year round until the wee hours of the steamy Bangkok night; and the durian orchard outside Bangkok, cherished by durian groupies for its more than two dozen varieties and 300 trees.\nChartree\u2019s six-acre orchard is a two-hour drive from Bangkok in the foothills of the Khorat Plateau, which extends into northeastern Thailand. He served us freshly harvested durian, pineapple and mangosteen, a small round purple fruit with sweet white flesh that many people believe is the perfect complement to durian. The orchard has an unusual genesis. Chartree\u2019s father planted the trees from durian pits he collected in the trash bins of wealthy Bangkok residents in the 1940s, making it a sort of seed bank of varieties that are no longer in commercial production. We were treated to a wonderful variety that Chartree has named nom sot (fresh milk). Other types in the orchard include gop (frog), chanee (a type of monkey) and la ong fa (a Thai sweet).\n\u201cOld people come here and say the durians here taste just like the durians they had when they were young,\u201d Chartree said.\nDurian is a very social fruit, usually eaten among friends. But I confess that I have sometimes eaten durian alone. Like eating birthday cake by yourself or drinking a tall boy out of a paper bag in a public park, it feels somewhat sad and illicit. Which brings up another point. As any durian fan will tell you, durian and alcohol don\u2019t mix.\nWith every durian season come stories about people who have collapsed \u2014 or worse \u2014 when they\u2019ve had large quantities of durian and alcohol. I have never read or heard of a scientific explanation for this, if there is one. But it is widely recognized that durian season can be deleterious to your health. A few years ago, after a routine physical checkup, I was told by my doctor that my triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood, were above normal. She gave me a pamphlet in which the first piece of advice was to cut down on durian or avoid it altogether.\nBut many of my fellow durian-loving friends are getting along in age, and it reassures me that, well, they are still alive. There are, after all, much more dangerous foods to consume than durian. Blowfish comes to mind.",
        "Amid a relentless anti-vaccine movement and measles outbreaks across the United States, a Texas lawmaker has falsely suggested that antibiotics can be used to treat the deadly childhood disease.\nTexas state Rep. Bill Zedler (R), an anti-vaxxer who is promoting legislation to allow parents to more easily opt out of vaccinations for their children, said he had measles when he was a child.\nZedler, who represents an area that includes Arlington, situated between Dallas and Fort Worth, could not immediately be reached for comment by The Washington Post.\nPublic health experts have warned against spreading bogus information about vaccines, thereby contributing to an anti-vaccine movement that has been sustained, in part, by fraudulent research from 1998 that purported to show a link between a preservative used in vaccines and autism. In the current measles outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, where anti-vaccine groups have long been active, more than 60 cases have been reported in Washington and Oregon.\nIn Texas \u2014 Zedler\u2019s state \u2014 there are now eight confirmed measles cases.\nEarlier this month, Darla Shine, the wife of White House communications director Bill Shine, took to Twitter to claim that illnesses such as measles, mumps and chickenpox \u201ckeep you healthy & fight cancer.\u201d Her statement prompted concern from public health experts, who said such erroneous claims could cause harm.\nBefore the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, an estimated 3 million to 4 million patients contracted the disease each year in the United States \u2014 and about 400 to 500 died, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nCDC data shows that from 2000 to 2018, there was an average of 140 measles cases per year in the United States. And there were three reported fatalities during that time \u2014 one in 2002, one in 2003 and one in 2015.\nEach year in the United States, legislation is introduced by anti-vaxxers that would make it easier to opt out of childhood vaccinations. However, research has shown that most bills that become law support public health.\nAccording to a study published late last year in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers who analyzed proposed and enacted vaccine legislation between 2011 and 2017 found that bills supporting vaccines were more likely to become law, even though there were slightly more bills considered to be anti-vaccine.\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Lena Sun reported, there are a number of state measures that would make it more difficult for parents to opt out of immunizations.",

        "Two of the most successful intelligence disinformation campaigns that survive today were put forth by British Intelligence and the Russian KGB during, and shortly after, World War II.\nDuring World War II, the British made a spectacular technological advancement in the form of early radar that allowed them to target German bombers flying toward England, particularly at night, when they were extraordinarily difficult to intercept. The radar was fabulously successful, and many new British fighter aces were baptized by fire through shooting down German bombers.\nNaturally, they wanted to hide this fact for as long as possible, so we can imagine the long meetings that took place to come up with a plan. One of the golden rules of disinformation is that the best lies are based on truth, a tenet often still used today.\nIn this case, they chose to lie using real information and settled on the fact that carrots are high in Vitamin A, which is a vitamin useful to eyesight. This was the true fact that was then stretched to substantiate the lie that British pilots had extraordinarily good night vision that allowed them to intercept and shoot down so many German bombers at night.\nA substantial propaganda campaign was undertaken to convince the British public of the truth of the false statement, in order to have German spies pick up the information and pass it back to the German military. No clear records are known that indicate if the disinformation campaign had any effect on the Germans, but it was so successful with the public that it benignly lives on to this day.\nThe USSR\u2019s KGB of days gone by had just as great, if not a greater, success, albeit less benign. Following World War II, when the atrocities of the Nazi regime came to light, it surfaced just how similar the governments of the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) were to each other. This was both a problem for the USSR, which had just occupied much of Eastern Europe, but also distasteful, since the Nazi and USSR leftist dictatorships had been implacable enemies.\nAs part of the early Cold War efforts, the CIA jumped into the fray and mounted a large information campaign, pointing out the truth of the similarities. Jews who had survived the Holocaust under the Nazis or Jews who had survived the purges of the USSR\u2019s Joseph Stalin were integral to the information campaign. Note that this is correctly classified as a clandestine information campaign and not a propaganda campaign, since the information was in fact true.\nThis effort was destroyed by The New York Times, who made public the CIA backing. The source of the information was almost certainly the USSR, who may have leaked the information to The New York Times or passed it through some other means.\nAt the same time, the Soviet Union put a propaganda countermeasures campaign in place, painting the Nazi regime as a fascist \u201cconservative\u201d movement and, therefore, not a socialist movement at all. This not only survives as a widespread false concept today, but also, because of its success as propaganda, it has been built upon using a variation on the central theme.\nA quote often attributed to UK wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill (though probably not said by him) is: \u201cThe fascists of the future will be called anti-fascists.\u201d This has come to fruition, as a number of today\u2019s socialist movements have adopted many of the early Nazi tactics used in their rise to power.\nOne need look no further than today\u2019s Antifa (Anti-Fascist) organizations for a perfect example.\nJust like the \u201cbrown shirts\u201d used by Hitler to help him rise to power, they march in the streets, wear a uniform (black hoods), attempt to stifle other opinions, use physical intimidation, and openly espouse the use of violence for political action. These were precisely the type of activities used by the Nazi brown shirts to help Hitler rise to power. These extreme tactics and violence are both tacitly and openly supported by the left in the United States.\nThis past October, Antifa held large demonstrations in the famously left-wing Portland, Oregon, where they were filmed verbally attacking an elderly man in his vehicle and abusing an older wheelchair-bound woman, among many other similar acts. Meanwhile, police stood by and took no action as they watched innocent people being abused.\nThis association or cooperation seems to run even to the highest levels within the Democratic Party, with the son of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine being widely reported to be affiliated with Antifa, following his arrest after a protest involving the group. Kaine was the Democratic vice-presidential running mate of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\nLeftist philosophy brought us Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Chairman Mao, and Saddam Hussein, to name a few, and continues to inflict most of the violence on the world that has killed many millions.\nBrad Johnson is a retired CIA senior operations officer and a former chief of station. He is president of Americans for Intelligence Reform.",
        "GRAHAM \u2014 Murder trials are complicated and demand more from lawyers and judges than almost any other crime, so it generally takes years to bring one to trial or to a plea bargain.\nBy the Times-News\u2019 count, there are 34 pending murder cases in the court system \u2014 that is, 34 people charged with the first- or second-degree murder in the cases of 19 victims.\nThe oldest case is about four years, though most are from 2016 and 2017.\nIt is possible for several of the older cases to be resolved in 2018, but that becomes complicated with turnover in the Alamance County District Attorney\u2019s Office as prosecutors leave, District Attorney Pat Nadolski finishes up his term this year, and Sean Boone, who won the May 8 Republican primary and faces no opposition in November, prepares to take over and reorganize the office.\nNearly four years ago, Jahmil Deshawn Ingram was charged with shooting David Israel Williams, 24, at Quality Inn on Maple Avenue in Burlington. His trial is scheduled for Nov. 13.\nAround 2:30 a.m. Aug. 31, 2014, according to investigators, Ingram\u2019s brother, Rahmil Dimitris Ingram, fought with 24-year-old Raphael Devante Currie, of Burlington. When Ingram opened fire, according to Burlington police, Currie sustained life-threatening gunshot wounds, but survived.\nWilliams, however, was part of the crowd nearby and was also shot. police took him to Alamance Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.\nThe hotel was crowded \u2014 police described it as \u201cchaos\u201d \u2014 with drugs and alcohol found in several rooms.\nOne of the few death-penalty cases pending in Alamance County is also one of the most brutal.\n911 calls came in at close to 8 p.m. June 13, 2015, of a man on fire running around on a gravel road near Hatchery Road and Interstate 40/85. Responders found Juan Mario Martinez Trujillo, 56, of Hillsborough, badly burned. He died Aug. 24, 2015, at UNC Medical Center.\nAccording to a police affidavit, friends of Trujillo said he had been involved in drug trafficking with a man called \u201cChilango,\u201d slang for a man from Mexico City, and that there was an ongoing dispute between them over $5,000 to $10,000. Police were later able to identify Torres-Acevedo as \u201cChilango\u201d and arrested him in January of 2016, accusing him of dousing Trujillo with an accelerant and setting him on fire.\nThe District Attorney\u2019s Office announced its intention to pursue the death penalty June 7, 2016.\nTorres-Acevedo is suspected of having drug cartel ties. He is now in the Marion Correctional Institution on a conviction for methamphetamine trafficking. His expected release date is Nov. 6, 2021, according to the N.C. Department of Public Safety.\nOne of the older, and more disturbing, pending murder cases is Joseph Wayne Goswick, 20, charged with first-degree murder in the death of his adoptive father, James Weston Goswick, 36, a well-known and well-liked Boy Scout leader and LabCorp worker, in January 2016 in their home on Brier Lane, Graham.\nWeston Goswick\u2019s body was found in the home\u2019s detached garage after coworkers reported him missing Jan. 21, 2016.\nWhen deputies went to check on him, Joseph Goswick, then 17, told them his father had been gone for several days to clear his head after the two had argued, though his car was still in the driveway, according to investigators. Coworkers told investigators, according to a search warrant application, that someone they suspected was Joseph had called in pretending to be Weston.\nGoswick was at the house with three friends when deputies came to check. He told deputies he wasn\u2019t sure if he had the key to the garage, when deputies found an open door, they saw what looked like a body under a blanket and withdrew to detain the people in the house and get a search warrant. Goswick said he and his father had gotten into a fight around the garage.\nMarks on both Goswicks made it look like there had been a fight, and investigators later said there was evidence the father had been kicked, beaten with a blunt object and strangled with a belt.\nAccording to court records, Goswick was evaluated at Central Regional Hospital, and found competent to stand trial, but his defense attorney, Alex Dawson, could still go for a mental-health defense, said First Assistant District Attorney Corey Santos, which would mean more evaluations from defense and prosecution experts.\nSantos said it is in the prosecution\u2019s interest for a defendant to get strong representation, though, to ensure a guilty verdict stands up on appeal.\nAbraham Fryar, 41, was charged with stabbing his brother, David Fryar, 43, to death July 4, 2015, outside the Homewood Avenue group home where he lived. Investigators had at least one person claiming to be a witness, and an admission from Fryar who later used two bloody $20 bills at a nearby store.\nFryar has a long history of mental-health issues and a several robbery and assault convictions, and has been transferred to Central Regional Hospital, where it is unclear if he will ever be able to stand trial, Santos said.\nWhile the case of Joseph David Fuller\u2019s murder is nearly six years old, the suspects were not charged until last fall.\nKevon Lamont Moore, 44, and Craig Elwood Williamson, 47, were charged with the first-degree murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and breaking and entering in Fuller\u2019s death Oct. 8, 2012.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies found Fuller, 38, dead from multiple gunshot wounds at a house in the 5500 block of Lindley Mill Road, Graham. Charges were filed against Moore and Williamson Nov. 16, 2017.\nPerceiving that as a threat against his son, Fuller refused to get on the floor and the two began to struggle. The man shot Fuller, who ran to the back door of the trailer and jumped out because there were no steps. The suspect then walked to the back door and again shot Fuller, who was trying to crawl under the trailer.\nThe intruder took $500 and a big-screen TV, according to warrants.\nAccording to a motion to reduce his bond, Williamson told investigators he was at Fuller\u2019s house \u2014 referred to as a \u201cknown drug dealer\u201d \u2014 when a masked man kicked in the door and struggled with Fuller as Williamson ran out the door. According to the filing, a woman present at the time can corroborate Williamson\u2019s account.\nThe motion also claims Moore was arrested with 33 grams of cocaine and could face trafficking and habitual-felon charges, giving him more incentive to lie to investigators.\nWilliamson is charged with conspiring with Moore and another unknown person to set Fuller up for the robbery.\nThe shooting death of Willie Thompson Jr., 26, of Deep Creek Church Road, Burlington, on May 20, 2015, is likely to come up for trial next year.\nDecarlos Bernard Barnes, 24, is charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, firing a gun into an occupied dwelling and drug possession.\nThompson was shot just before 3:30 a.m. May 20, 2015, outside the CV Mart/Coy\u2019s Exxon at 1846 N. Church St. and died shortly after of a chest wound. James Travarrus Withers, 24, of McKinley Street, Mebane, was shot in the leg.\nEarly on, police suspected jealousy over a hug given to Barnes\u2019 girlfriend in the store might have been the motive for the shooting, but another felony charge filed a year after Thompson\u2019s death seems to make that questionable. Barnes was charged with firing a .40-caliber bullet into a house where Thompson was staying with relatives a week before Thompson\u2019s murder.\nAfter fleeing the state, Barnes was arrested in Washington D.C. and returned to Alamance County in June 2015.\nBarnes has given notice of a self-defense defense, according to Santos.\nAnthony Lewis Capps, 26, was found dead with three bullet wounds, one in his torso and two in the back of his head, at 2:25 a.m. Feb. 16, 2016, at the intersection of Border Street and Wood Avenue, Burlington, and his 1993 Jeep Cherokee nearby.\nBarry Lynn Williams, 50, last known to live at 317 Atwater St., Burlington, turned himself in later that day and was charged with second-degree murder and possession of a firearm by a felon.\nAccording to a police search-warrant application, the confrontation may have been sparked by jealousy and drugs. Police said the men were known to each other through mutual acquaintances, and shouting was heard before the shooting started.\nPolice have called the shooting death of Kareem L. Johnson, 21, on June 20, 2016, a drug deal gone bad, and five young men face charges of first-degree murder and armed robbery: Tevin Devenita Crisp, 26; Keshawn Ter\u2019ll Chrisp, 19; Jaiquan Montique McDaniel, 21; Khalil Dyshaun Moore, 19; and Micah Keishaun Cameron, 19.\nThe circumstances are complicated and involve a number of violent crimes, according to investigators.\nIn the first shooting, June 20, 2016, at 702 Tillman St., police said, Johnson and Jalin Lewis Ferguson, then 21, were lured to the residence to be robbed. Johnson was shot and died from his injuries two days later.\nCrisp and Chrisp \u2014 who are cousins but spell their last names differently, police said \u2014 along with McDaniel, Moore, Cameron and possibly others were at the Tillman Street house at the time of the shooting.\nThree and a half hours later, after being interviewed by investigators regarding the Tillman Street shooting, Chrisp, Crisp, Ferguson and possibly others went back to Chrisp\u2019s apartment at 317 Caswell St.\nFerguson stepped outside behind the apartment building to talk to his mother on a cellphone and was approached by Cameron, who, according to investigators, shot Ferguson multiple times at 6:08 p.m., June 20, 2016. Cameron is charged with attempted first-degree murder in that shooting.\nPolice said Cameron shot Ferguson so he could not identify the shooters in Johnson\u2019s killing.\nThe death of Robert Nelson Gilley II, 52, was originally reported as an accident \u2014 a rifle misfiring after being dropped, Nov. 5, 2016. According to a search-warrant application from the Sheriff\u2019s Office, Stephen Adrian Ferriell, 44, told investigators he left Gilley for a while after they had been target shooting and found the man shot with the rifle on the ground.\nInvestigators found the evidence inconsistent with that story and charged Ferriell with voluntary manslaughter in January. Those charges were changed to first-degree murder May 21.\nChristina Marie Smith, 32, was shot dead in the head during the armed robbery of a low-level drug dealer in the room of the boarding house where she stayed, 1012 S. Main St., Room 12, Burlington.\nMarlow Laddell Southern, 35, Jasmine Dezira McNew, 28, Tyrees Nathanial Williams, 18, and Khalil Le\u2019Mon Starks, 22, are each charged with first-degree murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon in Smith\u2019s murder.\nAccording to search-warrant applications by Burlington police, Southern described as the cousin of Smith\u2019s boyfriend and roommate had come to the couple\u2019s door and entered their room briefly. That witness \u2014 who told investigators he had been selling crack cocaine that night \u2014 said he saw shadows under the door after Southern closed it and suspected a robbery. Two men, Williams and Starks, police say, came in as Southern left and robbed the witness of his remaining cocaine.\nSmith started shouting at the robbers, according to the statement in the warrant application, and one of them shot her in the head.\nWitnesses identified Southern\u2019s car, and he and McNew admitted to being at the house to buy crack. Investigators allege the couple conspired with Williams and Starks to commit the robbery.\nAshley Deneen Watlington, 35, is charged with the second-degree murder of Michael Darrell Lea in what investigators called a domestic assault at 3:15 a.m. Nov. 25, 2016, on the side of U.S. 70.\nHe died two days later at UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill.\nAccording to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, the couple was driving, but stopped.

Flores and Yancey later returned to confront him. Witnesses heard arguing and several gunshots.\nSeveral people were around, and a GPS monitoring bracelet Flores was wearing on his ankle at the time, issued by his bail bonding company for a shooting charge from the year before, confirmed to police that Flores \u201cwas in fact at the shooting scene,\u201d the investigator wrote.\nTwo people face the death penalty in the brutal murder of Harold D. Simpson, 84, last August.\nSean Damion Castorina, 42, and Penny Michelle Dawson, 40, are accused of killing Simpson in rural Caswell County in August 2017, and fleeing to Virginia where, according to the District Attorney\u2019s Office, they shot a woman and left her for dead, and ultimately were arrested in Fergus Falls, Minn.\nSimpson went missing Aug. 19, 2017. His silver 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt was found abandoned in Nelson County, Va., three days later, and according to police, items belonging to Castorina and Dawson were found inside.\nHuman remains believed to be Simpson\u2019s were found in late August off Totten Road in Caswell County.\nAccording to prosecutors, Dawson had befriended Simpson months before his death with the aim of getting money and support, and on Aug. 19, they got him to the isolated place, where they attacked Simpson, tried to strangle him, and then killed him by shoving his own walking stick down his mouth and throat.\nThe couple fled to Shipman, Va., where Castorina had a friend.

She survived and identified Castorina and Dawson.\nWhile the prosecution believes Simpson was killed in Caswell County, the defendants planned the murder and began the chain of events in Alamance County.\nCastorina was previously convicted in 2005 of second-degree murder in Johnston County and served 16 years, six months in prison, and was released months before Simpson\u2019s death.\nDarrell Kenan Clark, 54, is charged with first-degree murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon in the April 29, 2017, stabbing death of Daniel Lee Paul, 67.\nAccording to police, a passerby saw Paul through the window, lying on the floor of his apartment at 431 Sellars St. around midday and called 911. Firefighters arrived to administer aid and discovered what appeared to be a puncture wound in Paul's upper torso. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\nPolice determined that Paul had been robbed of his wallet and cash during an altercation, and investigators used surveillance video and witness statements to identify Clark.\nInvestigators believe the men knew each other.\nVincent Ramon Sowell Jr., 27, Marquette Travon Williams, 30, and Litego Dariyonta Marshall, 40, are all charged with first-degree murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon in the Dec. 21 death of Leonidas Brown, 32, 600 block of Ross Street, Burlington.\nAccording to court records, on Dec. 20 Brown was going to sell two pounds of marijuana, valued at $2,700, according to police reports \u2014 but became suspicious the buyers were actually going to rob him and pulled a gun, and the defendants shot him.\nHe was found with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, and taken to Duke University Medical Center for treatment, where he died from his injuries the following day.\nNajee Camille Moore, 17, is charged with the first-degree murder of Travonte Contrell Compton, 17, on Nov. 7, 2017.\nJust after 5 p.m. Tuesday Nov. 7, police and medics responded to the 300 block of Vance Street where Travonte Contrell Compton was suffering from a gunshot wound to the face.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.\nPolice believe Compton was driven to Vance Street from Chandler Avenue, where officers initially had responded to a report of shots fired.\nInvestigators think Moore acted alone in the shooting, but three other teens were charged with helping or harboring Moore after the murder, according to police, and, according to a search-warrant affidavit sworn by Burlington police Officer J. Theriault, Moore conspired with two others, Trenton Enoch and Laquan Knox, to shoot up a police station before he was arrested while detectives were investigating Compton\u2019s murder.\nSeveral law enforcement agencies collaborated to arrest Moore without incident Monday, Nov. 20, in a stolen car on Cherry Grove Road in Caswell County.\nMichael Thomas Le, 25, was shot dead in the robbery of Gone Fishing Sweepstakes, 1365 N.

        "Lawn sweepers are more efficient and less time consuming than raking leaves.\n3 What Kind of Rake to Use for Grass Seed?\nLawn sweepers operate with brushes underneath that pick up lawn debris and flip it into a hopper. The process is the same as a vacuum cleaner, but the brushes turn manually as you push a walk-behind sweeper. You may use a lawn sweeper to clean the yard after mowing it, or to clean fallen leaves and debris. An accumulation of dead grass and leaves on your lawn blocks sunlight and air from the grass and can kill the lawn. The process of using a lawn sweeper takes little time and your lawn will thank you for it.\nPut on leather work gloves to protect your hands from thorns or sharp objects. Pick up all branches, rocks, pinecones and other large debris in the area. Lawn sweepers will remove small twigs, grass clippings and leaves, but not large items.\nMow your lawn as you normally would. Lawn sweepers work better on freshly mowed grass that is all the same height.\nAdjust the brush height on a lawn sweeper to the same height as the grass. Some models have a dial to turn or a handle to move forward or backward for brush adjustments. Look under the sweeper and move the adjustment apparatus until the brushes touch the grass.\nStart pushing the lawn sweeper in one corner of your lawn. Travel in paths back and forth across the lawn in opposite directions of either north to south or east to west. At the end of a path turn the lawn sweeper around and place the tires in the track of the finished path to overlap each path slightly for good coverage. Walk at a medium pace about at the speed as if you are push mowing your lawn.\nSpread a large tarp on the ground on an area that you have swept when the hopper is full of debris. Push the lawn sweeper to the tarp. Dump the contents of the sweeper bin onto the tarp. There may be a string or a handle to pull that opens the hopper to deposit the contents of the hopper.\nFold the tarp in half with the contents inside. Open a lawn and leaf bag with the opening facing upward. Pour the grass clippings and leaves inside the bag. Alternately, you may deposit the debris in a compost pile or green bin.\nContinue sweeping the lawn in paths and emptying the hopper until you have covered the entire lawn in paths.\nWalk-behind lawn sweepers are inexpensive and available at home improvement and garden centers.\nStore your lawn sweeper in a dry area such as a garage or storage shed.\nTow-behind lawn sweepers attach to a riding mower and operate in the same way. Most have a pull rope that you access while on the mower to open the hopper and empty it without leaving your seat.\nLawn sweepers are not efficient on wet grass. Allow your lawn to dry a day or so after a rainfall before sweeping it.\nLougee, Mary. \"How to Pick Up Grass Clippings and Leaves with a Lawn Sweeper.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/pick-up-grass-clippings-leaves-lawn-sweeper-45990.html.

        "Openly Gay Muslim Imam Reacts to Orlando: Clubs Like Pulse are Safe Havens for LGBT Muslims, Too | Democracy Now!\nexecutive director of Mecca Institute. Imam Abdullah also is one of the first openly gay imams in the Western Hemisphere.\nAuthorities have identified the Orlando gunman as 29-year-old Omar Mateen. He was born in 1986 in New York to Afghan parents. Since 2007 Mateen had worked as a security guard at G4S, the largest private security firm in the world. The FBI interviewed Mateen in 2013 and 2014 for possible terrorist ties. According to The New York Times, he was placed under FBI surveillance for a time, but the agency eventually closed its inquiry. There are reports that Mateen called 911 around the time of the assault and declared his allegiance to the Islamic State, but no audio of the call has been released to the public. We speak to Imam Daayiee Abdullah, executive director of Mecca Institute. Imam Abdullah also is one of the first openly gay imams in the Western Hemisphere.\nAMY GOODMAN: Vigils are being held across the country following what\u2019s been described as the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. At least 50 people died in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning after a gunman opened fire at a packed gay dance club. More than 50 others were injured, the victims overwhelmingly Latino and young, between 20 and\u2014in their twenties and thirties. Authorities identified the gunman as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, who used a semiautomatic weapon that would have been prohibited under the assault weapons ban that Congress allowed to expire more than a decade ago. On Sunday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the shooting. This is the group\u2019s executive director, Nihad Awad.\nNIHAD AWAD: Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the victims of their\u2014with the victims and their families. We offer condolences to the families, and we pray for the recovery of the survivors. This is a hate crime, plain and simple. We condemn it in the strongest possible terms. It violates our principles as Americans and as Muslims.\nAMY GOODMAN: Joining us now is Imam Daayiee Abdullah, executor director of Mecca Institute, one of the first openly gay imams in the Western Hemisphere.\nWelcome to Democracy Now! Can you show your thoughts, Imam Daayiee Abdullah, about what took place in Orlando, Florida, this weekend?\nIMAM DAAYIEE ABDULLAH: Yes. Thank you, Amy, for inviting me. And I\u2019m wearing black today because I\u2019m still in mourning, because I want to give out condolences to the families and friends of the\u2014and the community there\u2014of the victims there in Orlando, and basically to say that, overall, violence is never the answer to any type of response, but there are a number of different issues that, in intersection, lead to a major question as to why these things happen. It\u2019s not just because of an individual with just hate, but there are things that underlie the reasoning behind them so that they can choose to use violence as a way to make a statement.\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about how the media is portraying what took place? I mean, when the words across the bottom of the screen, when people woke up yesterday, on television, \u201cterror attack,\u201d you almost knew immediately it wasn\u2019t a white supremacist who did this, because it would have said \u201cwhite supremacist attack.\u201d \u201cTerror\u201d has become synonymous with \u201cMuslim\u201d in this country. Can you describe your response to hearing who was involved with this attack and what they\u2019re saying about Omar Mateen right now?\nIMAM DAAYIEE ABDULLAH: OK, well, typically, like any other attack that has happened, most Muslims, you know, there\u2019s a gasp of breath, and they go, \u201cI hope that they\u2019re not Muslim.\u201d And there\u2019s times, as being a black male, that I hope it wasn\u2019t a black male that did this. So it\u2019s a very similar feeling. But the way in which the media has portrayed, and continues to portray, it has gotten better, but the problem is that there\u2019s always this leap directly towards, if the person is Muslim that did it, then it\u2019s terrorism rather than someone who may have a mental illness or someone who have other causes that led them to fall into the process of using violence in terms of what they do.\nSo, I think that, generally, when it\u2019s a white male, then it\u2019s mental illness is the first thing that they utilize after reporting the crime. But in this instance, it\u2019s always terrorism. And as Donald Trump commented yesterday evening, that this is\u2014you know, keep the Muslims out. So it\u2019s always a direct attack towards Muslims, who are American citizens, and as well as other individuals who are here who believe in their faith. And we find that we are now in a position again of trying to protect ourselves, and, again, in some instances, causing people to become more sequestered in their day-to-day lives.\nAMY GOODMAN: You talk about mental illness, and you talk\u2014we just played a clip of Sitora Yusufiy, his wife, his ex-wife, who said that he was mentally ill and that he beat her when he was married to her, Imam.\nIMAM DAAYIEE ABDULLAH: Yes. Well, one of the issues I think is very important, in many communities of color, there\u2019s a stigma about mental health. And in my pastoral counseling that I provide to not only LGBT Muslims, but also young Muslims, interfaith couples, older Muslims who are now in a different culture, we find that the shaming that comes from acknowledging that one may have some issues that may relate to mental health, often people are not willing to go and seek additional help because of that shaming or that cultural stigma that\u2019s associated with it. And I think that we need to make this change in how people approach mental health, so that people can be helped much earlier in the process if they should exhibit certain issues or certain ways of\u2014in which we show there\u2019s some mental illness issues.\nAMY GOODMAN: If you could talk about also his fascination with guns? Speaking to reporters Sunday, his ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, also described Mateen\u2019s interest in guns.\nSITORA YUSUFIY: He wanted to be a police officer. So he trained with his friends who are police officers, and he had a license to have a gun in Florida. You\u2019re allowed to do that. So, he didn\u2019t practice anything in front of me, but I\u2019m sure he went to shooting ranges.\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Sitora Yusufiy. Your response, Imam?\nIMAM DAAYIEE ABDULLAH: Well, in growing up in Detroit, Michigan, both of my parents were gun owners, and that they taught us how to safely and carefully utilize them, because we had businesses, and they showed us out of a sense of protection. But that was something that was used to never use a gun unless you intend\u2014never, you know, play with a gun unless you use it to intend\u2014intend to use it. But it was for protection only.\nAnd I think one of the issues quite often, from a mental health perspective, that people find power behind a gun. And I think this may be one of the issues that was prevalent with Mateen, in that he used that as a source of power where he may have felt powerless. There are other speculations for reasons why he may have felt powerless, too, which I\u2019m not certain if we should even try to delve into until we have more information about it. But frequently, that is the issue behind most people. They feel a loss of power. They use a gun to sort of equalize things. And, of course, once the process begins, quite often people die in that process.",

        "Nobody asked me, but \u2026 if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to a Holocaust denial conference and have a Holocaust denial DVD in your video collection, then you're probably a neo-Nazi.\nThat does not mean you are once and for all a neo-Nazi. You can have a change of heart and a change of mind, and come clean. If you want people to believe you are no longer a neo-Nazi, you have a lot of convincing to do. It takes a lot of work to shake the brown shirt.\nBut if you never disavow your affiliation with a neo-Nazi organization, if you never risk public shame and the loss of a job by coming out of the white-supremacist closet, then you might one day find yourself outed by the Southern Poverty Law Center. And you'll look like a guy who made no effort to break with his sorry past in a way that might warrant some sympathy.\nSomething like that happened to a 65-year-old attorney who had a contract with the city of Baltimore to handle some sensitive litigation. Apprised of the situation, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's administration decided posthaste last week to end its relationship with attorney Glen Keith Allen, a contract employee outed for having been a supporter of the neo-Nazi National Alliance.\nAllen didn't put up a squawk. He went quietly, agreeing to have his contract terminated.\nWhen contacted by The Baltimore Sun, he described himself as a casual member of the National Alliance in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He acknowledged buying some books published by the alliance and providing the organization with some legal advice. But he said he hasn't been a member in more than a decade.\n\"Whether you believe me or not,\" he told The Sun, \"I'm not a member of the National Alliance, haven't been for many years.\"\nOf his past affiliation with the group, he said, \"I will acknowledge emphatically that that was a huge mistake.\"\nFine, but it's too late. And you get the feeling Allen realized that.\nAdmitting you once paid dues to a neo-Nazi group is not like saying you smoked pot in college. It's far more serious, especially if you maintained the habit well beyond the youthful experimentation stage.\nSo, yeah, Allen knew what was coming, and his deal with the city is over. So is the city's deal with the man who hired him. George Nilson is no longer city solicitor.\nBaltimore City Solicitor George A. Nilson said Saturday that he believes he was \"mistreated\" by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who fired him from city government Friday without meeting with him.\nAll of this because Allen did not take the time, a decade ago, to shake his connection with the National Alliance in some way that might have made his past affiliation tolerable, if not forgivable.\nI don't think people should lose their jobs because of what they think. We should abhor negative consequences for personally held beliefs. But, in this case, what happened was in the best interest of citizens of Baltimore.\nSorry, but you don't get to keep secret your onetime affinity for a neo-Nazi group and take part in the city's legal defense of a lawsuit brought by a black man who alleges that Baltimore police withheld and fabricated evidence to convict him wrongfully of murder. And this in the midst of a serious municipal conversation about systemic racism punctuated by a Department of Justice report on police violations of civil rights, particularly in poor, black neighborhoods.\nI can defend Allen's right to believe whatever he wants, no matter how disgusting, but not his right to have that kind of job.\nNobody asked me, but \u2026 it looks like his superiors at the Baltimore Police Department missed their \"teachable moment\" for Officer Wesley Cagle in 2013. Cagle was recently convicted of assault for shooting an unarmed burglary suspect who had already been wounded by Cagle's fellow officers. But that was not the first time Cagle had used unnecessary force. Three years ago, he used a Taser on a man who had already complied with an order from Cagle's fellow officers.\nThat man, Tavon Sherman, filed a lawsuit seeking $400,000 in damages from the city. According to records, Sherman had been a passenger in a vehicle the officers stopped on Oct. 6, 2013. The officers discovered an open warrant for Sherman. He and the officers got into an altercation. Cagle ordered Sherman to sit on a curb. Records say Sherman complied, \"but Officer Cagle tased the plaintiff when he continued to flail.\"\nThe city settled the lawsuit for $35,000. The Board of Estimates approved that sum last November. A member of the board, Mayor Rawlings-Blake, has defended her record on police conduct by pointing to something she pushed years ago in City Council: a \"teachable moments\" policy to reduce the chances for future complaints of excessive force. Given what happened in December 2014 \u2014 Cagle's wounding of an already wounded suspect \u2014 either the officer didn't get his \"teachable moment,\" or he didn't pay attention in detention.",

Meanwhile, its five-star rating for employability is a testament that the active student involvement at the university positively impact and develop their passion and transfer their experience into a rewarding career.\nThe modern 880,000 sq ft campus \u2013 which boast a FIFA accredited football field, a library with a Harvard Collection and world-class auditoriums \u2013 is once again, recognised as the best in its class with a five-star rating.\nIt also welcomes the addition of Sunway iLabs Makerspace this year, a venue created to help and assist young geniuses and budding entrepreneurs.\nThe opening of the first ever Jeffrey Sachs Centre for Sustainable Development in Asia by the Prime Minister was a huge compliment to Sunway and paid tribute to the work that was being done at the institute in support of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nA total of 8,165 people joined hands to celebrate the third anniversary of UN Sustainable Development Goals in Sunway City.\nIn 2018, Jeffrey Sachs Centre for Sustainable Development successfully launched a dedicated programme developed around the 17 goals, allowing Malaysians the chance to pursue their passion for the environment with a Masters in Sustainable Development Management.\nIn addition, to celebrate the third anniversary of the UN SDGs being launched, Sunway University organised Join Hands and Make the Pledge, a community event that saw 8,165 people including leading corporate figures, ambassadors, ministers and celebrities come together to support the SDGs in Asia.\nThe number of participants denoted the exact distance in nautical miles between Sunway University and the UN building in New York.\nThese endeavours were also reflected in the recent QS ratings when the university was, once again, awarded the top marks of QS five-star for social responsibility.\nThe Jeffrey Cheah Foundation\u2019s scholarships and bursaries demonstrate the university\u2019s commitment to extend access to higher education and inclusivity for those from low-income and challenging backgrounds. This noble move has earned Sunway University the QS 5 Stars for inclusiveness.\nThe university also enjoys Tier 5 \u201cExcellent\u201d rating in the National SETARA quality assessment \u2013 a rating that has been consistently maintained since 2009.\nAll these accolades bear testament to Sunway\u2019s resolve in ensuring high-quality teaching, research and service excellence by offering a collaborative learning environment for both academics and students alike, justifying its position among the top 2% of universities in Asia.\nOver recent times, the institution's ability to forge successful relationships with the worlds global brands in education has seen collaborations with Harvard University, Oxford University and Cambridge University.\nThis impressive line-up of affiliations has seen the new addition of the University of California, Berkeley, which will host a Start-up Semester at Berkeley in partnership with Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology (SCET).\nSunway University won Gold for Education in the 2018 Putra Brand Awards.\nThe university\u2019s foundations and success have been built through the ongoing support and positive relationship with both students and parents alike. This positive trilogy of communication was also recently recognised at the 2018 Putra Brand Awards.\nPutra Brands utilize a robust consumer research methodology developed by an AC Nielsen, 7000 consumers determined Malaysia\u2019s favourite brands within multiple categories, with each category being awarded a Gold, Silver and/or Bronze for the most preferred brands. Hence, the judges of the Putra Brand Awards are the Malaysian consumers themselves.\nReceiving the Gold for Education in the Putra Brand Awards is clear proof of the parents\u2019 trust in the integrity and reputation of Sunway University.\nAnd it is not just the parents who have supported Sunway University, the thriving and engaged student community have also propelled the university onto social media with great effect. Campus life is never dull and with numerous activities and international events being held on campus, it is of little wonder Sunway now also enjoys a reputation as the #MostHappeningCampus in Malaysia.\nHosting the Jeffrey Cheah Distinguished Speaker Series, Nobel Prize winners, Prime Ministers, leading global figures, ambassadors, film crews, the Popular American Education Day alongside celebrity chefs, World Cup winners, as well as United Nations events, have well merited the #MostHappeningCampus popularised by the students across social media platforms.\nContinuing the effort to fly the flag for Malaysian education overseas, Sunway University became the first education institution in Malaysia to sponsor a football team in the English FA Cup. The university sponsored the team\u2019s jersey when they competed against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley stadium and attracted a global audience of 150 million worldwide.\nThe most happening campus will also play host to the ASEAN Emerging Researchers Conference on Dec 3 and 4. Jointly organised by CUMAS, Sunway University, Wolfson College (Cambridge) and Young Scientists Network Malaysia. The highlight of which will be a Gala Dinner where Cambridgians are encouraged to wear their academic gowns.\nThis ever-increasing international reputation recently culminated at the prestigious World Branding Awards, held at Kensington Palace, London. Sunway University became the World Brand of the Year 2018-2019 in Tertiary Education.\nSunway University truly lived up to its status as \u201cA Class Above\u201d in 2018 and is determined to offer even greater opportunities for both students and parents next year.\nTo learn more about their programmes and upcoming intakes at Sunway University, visit the Open Day on Dec 15 and 16 from 10am to 4pm.\nOr for more details, visit www.university.sunway.edu.my.",
        "Although a relatively new brand, Roger Dubuis has managed to create a wonderful success story for itself in the two decades since its founding in 1995 by businessman Carlos Dias and its namesake, watchmaker Roger Dubuis, whose goal was to create distinctive watches and manufacture movements. By 2001 the company had begun building its own modern factory on the outskirts of Geneva to accommodate the prolific and creative horology and new movements stamped with the prestigious Seal of Geneva \u2013 a quality certification only very few watch companies can boast having on any of their movements, much less the entire production.\nRoger Dubuis was acquired by leading luxury group Richemont in 2008, after which the collections were downsized to provide customers with a more focused line of unique watches. While ladies\u2019 watches never disappeared from the Roger Dubuis collection, they certainly did not have the same technical and inspired design focus they previously had \u2013 until 2016.\nThis past year has been the declared year of women at Roger Dubuis \u2013 and if you think these new timepieces are your regular \u201cfemale fare,\u201d please have a look at this gallery of the brand\u2019s 2016 products. These are interesting watches in visual, technical, and mechanical senses (even if the \u201cdiva\u201d marketing used in connection with the watches aimed at women is perhaps a tad overplayed; the idea is to relay to prospective female consumers that \u201cthey are spectacular\u201d).\nBut the standout is certainly the most technical of them: the Black Velvet Paraiba. This beautiful timepiece is housed in a speckled carbon fiber case, the construction of which is anything but usual. To achieve this look, Roger Dubuis\u2019s technicians and case maker begin with a non-directional random fiber sheet that is layered and then machined using diamond-coated tools. The dial is crafted using the same technique. As special and beautiful as that is if you like extremely lightweight, black watches, it\u2019s still not even close to the incredible technical feat that setting 66 Paraiba tourmaline gemstones into this material is. This is naturally a world first in watchmaking: mechanically setting incredibly rare and beautifully sourced gemstones of this magnitude into a carbon material that is nearly impossible to work once it is cured. There is no other way to describe this: it is a difficult yet delicate task that hardly another watch brand would have dared to even attempt. For more technical information and loads of beautiful and original photography, please see Carbon Cases: A Lesson In Differences With Roger Dubuis\u2019s Black Velvet Paraiba And Excalibur Skeleton Carbon.\nThe Black Velvet Paraiba, limited to just 88 pieces, is powered by Roger Dubuis\u2019s own automatic Caliber RD821; it retails for $59,300.

        "KENAI, Alaska (KTUU) - Steep cuts in the Governor's proposed budget have led the Kenai Peninsula Borough School Board to grapple with the very real potential that some schools in its area may need to be shut down or consolidated. Before that happens, officials want to hear what residents think about it.\nMeetings will be held in different schools on Thursday and next week to provide that opportunity. According to the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District, that's its way of being proactive to find out how the public feels, rather than waiting until cuts are certain to make the tough calls.\nKPBSD wrote in a release Thursday that those conversations are important for determining the district's future, and listed dates and locations for residents to attend.\n\"With fiscal uncertainty at the state and borough levels, it is an act of due diligence to have the conversations in order to learn community concerns and thoughts,\" Pegge Erkeneff, spokesperson for KPBSD, wrote in the release. \"KPBSD is being proactive to explore a number of possibilities to meet potentially significant funding cuts in all areas of our district, including southern, central, and eastern peninsula schools.\"\nThe budget in question was proposed by Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy, and has been called significant in depth for schools not only in the Kenai Peninsula Borough, but also across the state.\n\"It is unlikely that school closures would occur in the Seward or Homer area as fast as the 2019-2020 school year, unless the Governor\u2019s proposed budget stands,\" the release states. \"Timing of any potential school consolidations in the Seward or Homer areas is unknown, and at this time, school closures or consolidations would be dependent upon funding from the state in FY20 and beyond.\"\nThree meetings were announced for impacted areas of the borough, including Seward, Soldotna and Homer.\nThe Seward meeting will be on April 11, 2019, 6:30 p.m., William H. Seward Elementary School. Officials say the potential closure will be consolidating Seward Middle School (6-8) into Seward High School (9-12), and William H. Seward Elementary (6th).\nKPBSD said this merge would mean a saving of $409,000 in operating costs.\nThe Soldotna-area meeting will be held April 11, 2019, 6:00 p.m. at the Soldotna High School auditorium.\nThe proposed consolidation in Soldotna is to move Soldotna ninth grade students from Soldotna Prep to Soldotna High School, and to relocate River City Academy.\nThe moves would save the district approximately $630,000 each year.\nThe Homer meeting will be held on April 15, 2019, 6:00 p.m., Homer High School commons. They'll be discussing potentially consolidating Homer Middle School and Homer High School.\nFor Homer, Erkeneff wrote, \"No decisions have been made, and your thoughts are valuable.\"\nCombining the two schools would result in a savings of $459,000 in operating costs, and avoid deferred maintenance costs of approximately $10,000,000, the borough estimated.\nAn online survey for public input is available for those who can't attend the meetings in person. The Seward survey is located online here.\nThe Soldotna survey is online here.\nThe Homer survey is located online here.",
        "Before Port O'Brien formed as a duo in 2005, lead female singer Cambria Goodwin worked in a small Alaskan bakery while the male lead, Van Pierszalowski, spent months at sea on his father's fishing boat.\nToday, having released their second album, \"Threadbare,\" on TBD Records on Oct. 6, and in the middle of a worldwide tour with indie rock singer/songwriter Seawolf, Port O'Brien seems a long way off from pressing cake dough and making fish bate.\nStill, the dedication, modesty and self-reliance learned from hard labor has spilled over into their music. Shortly after uniting, the coastal California band added a rhythm section and in 2008 they independently released their debut, \"All We Could Do Was Sing.\"\n\"Some bands will receive a huge advance and blow every penny of it on recording, but I really don't think you need a hundred grand to record an album,\" says Pierszalowski.\nHis attitude on touring is similarly down to earth. \"We just like to keep it honest and fresh and in the moment,\" he says. \"Performing is basically just for the audience -- trying to give them some kind of memorable experience. It doesn't matter if we're playing with Modest Mouse or playing a show in Missouri with only five people.\"\nAccording to Pierszalowski, the biggest advantage of being a full-time band now is the bonds they've birthed and the ability of having more creative minds to work with; when their creative juices don't suffice, their unity kicks in and individual matters affect them all, including the unfortunate passing of Goodwin's younger brother.\n\"If you can say anything positive about tragedy, you can say it puts your life in focus, and it put our album in focus,\" says Pierszalowski. \"So, part of it is dealing with depression and dealing with the anxiety but it's also realizing what you can learn from that and making active changes based on that. We wanted to incorporate things that came from those feelings.\"\nThe unexpected change within the group also led to more practical changes on the album, the most noticeable -- and effective -- being Goodwin's vocals being featured more prominently this time around than on the bands' debut. \"It wasn't an active decision we made, it just seemed like there was no other way,\" Pierszalowkski says, stating it all happened organically. \"She had a lot more to say than I did this time around.\"\nThis focused and sincere partnership grounds \"Threadbare.\" The band's \"beardiness,\" as Pierszalowski puts it, might draw simple comparisons to indie campfire bands like Akron/Family, Bon Iver, or Fleet Foxes, but Port O'Brien is not making music to fit it.\n\"On 'Threadbare' everything was immediately collaborative. We like a lot of different types of music and I think that every song on 'Threadbare' is pretty different, but it still felt a lot more cohesive than anything we've done before,\" he says. \"We always try to cover a lot of ground and not try to be pigeonholed into one specific production style or one form of instrumentation. We felt a strong connection with every song and how they fit together.\"",
        "Tanks, jet fighters and even Mothra could never put Godzilla down for the count, so Americans found a less conventional way to kill off the classic movie monster: ritual humiliation.\nFor five decades, the creature has been bombarded with every embarrassment that this nation's entertainment industry could muster, from Raymond Burr and the Blue Oyster Cult to something called \"The Godzilla Power Hour.\" The Japanese viewed Godzilla as both a fearsome killing machine and an important metaphor about the dangers of nuclear testing and not thinking about the future. Americans saw him as another trendy character to slap on children's lunch boxes.\nAn uncut version of \"Gojira,\" the Japan-made 1954 debut of Godzilla, gets released today for the first time on DVD. Consider it pop culture reparations for generations of embarrassment, starting in 1956, when \"Gojira\" was sliced and diced into \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\" -- which added scenes with Burr and all but eliminated the important political messages in the film.\nGodzilla over the years suffered many horrible slights at the hands of Hollywood, but the disregard of Japanese culture by Americans can best be summed up in one word.\nThis annoying reptilian imbecile from \"The Godzilla Power Hour\" is perhaps our greatest argument that the 1970s was the suckiest decade ever. Godzooky could fly around using tiny wings, which was ridiculous to begin with because his body looked as if he dined on nothing but the Burger King dollar menu.\nGodzooky was the nephew of Godzilla. His deal with scientists on board the ship the Calico was almost identical to Moe Greene's agreement with Michael Corleone regarding Fredo in \"The Godfather\": The scientists tried to ignore the fact that Godzooky kept getting everyone into trouble, and in return Godzilla would bail the humans out every time the fat little idiot screwed up.\nMuch like Bigfoot, who battled \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" and \"The Incredible Hulk\" on television, Godzilla became a caricature in the 1970s and 1980s. Blue Oyster Cult followed the cowbell-laden 1976 hit \"(Don't Fear) the Reaper\" with a song called \"Godzilla.\" The character became green in American versions and developed ridiculous powers (laser vision and fire breath?) that had nothing to do with his radioactive origins. Even Burr returned, infecting the series again in \"Godzilla 1985.\"\nThe man in the suit is the genius of \"Gojira,\" and also the character's downfall. Watched in its proper context, the emotional impact of the movie is in the same league with that of the 1933 \"King Kong.\" The special effects were excellent for the time, with model work that still looks impressive. Best of all, unlike current blockbuster movies with special effects so seamless that they force the brain to take a two-hour vacation, \"Gojira\" forced kids to use their imaginations.\nTo be fair, Toho Studios, which created Godzilla, released its own substandard sequels -- making the character an even easier target for American smart-asses in the entertainment industry. The man in the suit, now a synonym for \"cheesy movie,\" became a much less effective tool as the Japan-made films were shot in color, the model-making got worse and the writing got more ridiculous.\nWhen satirists such as the creators of \"South Park\" and \"Arrested Development\" poke fun at Godzilla movies, their reference point is almost always the lesser Japanese Godzilla films from the 1970s and 1980s -- in part because \"Gojira\" hasn't been available. Imagine if the original \"Rocky\" didn't exist in Japan, and the Japanese people's only contact with the character was \"Rocky IV,\" \"Rocky V\" and that Saturday morning cartoon starring Mr. T.\nThe American version is a typical starring vehicle for Burr, who is spliced into the older footage in ridiculous ways, and gives \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\" a know-it-all narration that ignores the point of the original film. The difference between the films is highlighted by the final soliloquies -- one by a Japanese scientist named Dr. Kyohei Yamane and another by Burr's Steve Martin character.\nDr. Yamane: \"If we keep conducting nuclear tests, it's possible that another Godzilla might appear somewhere in the world, again.\"\nMartin: \"The menace was gone (and) so was a great man. But the whole world could wake up and live again!\"\n\"Gojira\" will be a revelation for people who have never seen the more serious side of \"Godzilla.\" In fact, you may feel a moral duty to buy three copies of the film: one to watch, one to keep for your grandchildren and one with which to pelt studio types responsible for that horrible Matthew Broderick \"Godzilla\" movie that came out in 1998.\nAs stupid as \"The Godzilla Power Hour\" was, I can only imagine what it was like to be a 12-year-old whose first experience with the creature was the Dean Devlin/Roland Emmerich \"Godzilla\" movie. The character looks more like an iguana than the classic Godzilla, has the ability to lay eggs like a chicken and (gasp!) was made with Hollywood special effects instead of a man in a suit.\nThat movie tanked at the box office, which turned out to be a huge blessing because it saved us from the sequels -- other than a slightly less hideous Saturday morning cartoon that ran for a few years and is mostly forgotten now.\nThe spectacular failure of Hollywood's \"Godzilla\" has worked as kind of a palate cleanser, keeping Godzilla products out of the commerce stream for a few years. Now the man in the suit is back, and it couldn't come at a better time.",
        "England's two most successful clubs will come head to head at Anfield on Monday (Tuesday morning, Oct 18, Singapore time), with Jurgen Klopp keen to avenge Manchester United's English Premier League double over Liverpool last season.\nHere's a look at the key battles that will define this big match.\nThe Liverpool captain is in arguably the best form of his career - He has had the most touches (711) and most passes (589) not only for Liverpool this season, but in the whole of the EPL, as he dictates play in the middle. Pogba plays a similar key role in midfield for United, creating 11 chances for his team-mates so far although he has yet to record an assist.\nLiverpool have yet to keep a clean sheet in the league this season but goalkeeper Karius is expected to keep his place, despite Simon Mignolet pressing hard to reclaim the No. 1 spot. The big test for Karius is to keep the world-class Ibrahimovic, United's top scorer this term with six goals in all competitions, quiet.\nNew boy Mane's dynamic and speedy forward play has brought a sense of excitement and optimism to Liverpool, with three goals and three assists. He will be up against a top-class goalkeeper in de Gea, who is remembered at Anfield last season for making crucial saves either side of the halves before Wayne Rooney scored the winner in a 1-0 victory.\nCoutinho was impressive for Liverpool in their last league game as they came from behind to beat Swansea 2-1. The Brazilian maestro will be key as he can find pockets of space to spread panic in defences. His brilliant solo goal in the Europa League against the Red Devils is still fresh in the memories of both sets of supporters. But it will not be easy against Bailly, who has been rock solid in the heart of United's defence, picking up multiple Man-of-the-Match awards since his move from Villarreal in the summer.\nThis is the first time the two big-personality managers face off as the managers of Liverpool and United. They clashed on five previous occasions (four times for Borussia Dortmund vs Real Madrid and once for Liverpool vs Chelsea) with Klopp winning thrice and drawing once. The German's high-pressing style of play will be a threat to United, who have had slow build-ups to their game this campaign. However, Mourinho's side have shown that they too can conjure up a fast-paced attack, notably in their last two matches against Stoke City and Leicester City.",
        "President Bush's plan to send more troops to Iraq ran into a wall of criticism on Capitol Hill on Thursday as administration officials drew confrontational and sometimes mocking challenges from both Democrats and Republicans.\nDefense Secretary Robert Gates said in response that the administration might abandon the increase if the Iraqi government doesn't do its part, but he provided no timetable. \"I think most of us, in our minds, are thinking of it as a matter of months, not 18 months or two years,\" he told the House Armed Services Committee.\nBush and top members of his national security team sought to rally support for the troop buildup a day after he unveiled his plan for turning around a conflict that has lasted nearly four years and cost the lives of more than 3,000 American military personnel.\nInstead, Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice found themselves embroiled in the first pitched exchanges in a battle that is likely to dominate Congress for months or longer and is already shaping the 2008 presidential election.\n\"I think this speech given last night by this president represents the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam, if it's carried out,\" Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a potential 2008 presidential contender, told Rice.\nAs many as a dozen Republican senators could jump ship on the plan, reports CBS News correspondent Gloria Borger. As for the Democrats, their \"no's\" were nearly unanimous.\n\"Why should we give you the benefit of the doubt this time, when it appears so evident that so many mistakes have been made in the past?\" said Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla.\nHis colleague, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., noted his own past support for the administration on the war but said he could not continue. He declared, \"I have not been told the truth over and over again by administration witnesses, and the American people have not been told the truth.\"\nAmericans' opinions apparently were not swayed very much by President Bush's speech outlining his new strategy, according to a poll.\nFifty percent of those who saw the speech said they disapprove of the president's proposals, while 37 percent said they approve. Just one-third of those surveyed said they support Mr. Bush's call to send more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq.\nFollowing the speech, 68 percent of Americans \u2014 the same number as prior to the speech \u2014 said they were uneasy about the president's ability to make decisions about Iraq.\nBush, visiting with troops at Fort Benning, Ga., cautioned that the troop increase \"is not going to yield immediate results. It's going to take a while.\"\n\"American patience is limited, and obviously if the Iraqis fail to maintain their commitments we'll have to revisit our strategy,\" said Gates.\nAt one point Gates, just three weeks on the job, told lawmakers, \"I would confess I'm no expert on Iraq.\" Later, asked about reaching the right balance between American and Iraqi forces, he told the panel he was \"no expert on military matters.\"\nCommittee members pressed Gates, who replaced Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon, on an exit strategy for the United States.\n\"At the outset of the strategy, it's a mistake to talk about an exit strategy,\" he said.\nGates, in testimony to the committee and earlier at a news conference, said he was requesting increasing the size of the Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 troops over the next five years. He also said the Pentagon would recall to duty sooner than planned some National Guard and Reserve troops who have served yearlong tours in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nAs Rice testified to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., likened Bush's plan to a \"Hail Maliki pass\" \u2014 jokingly combining Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's name with the football \"Hail Mary\" desperation pass.\nThe U.S. led a coalition that invaded Iraq in March 2003, despite failing to win U.N. Security Council support. The government of Saddam Hussein quickly crumbled and Bush declared major combat operations over two months later.\nBush's war effort initially had strong support, both in Congress and among other Americans. Yet that support has eroded as violence has continued.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he hoped to bring up a nonbinding resolution next week expressing opposition to any troop buildup. A similar move is expected in the House.\nReid, in a Senate speech, said Bush ignored the results of November's midterm elections that ended 12 years of GOP control of Congress, the advice of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and that of his own top generals. \"In choosing to escalate the war, the president virtually stands alone,\" Reid said.\nThe Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, threatened a filibuster \u2014 a delaying tactic \u2014 to block any legislation expressing disapproval of the buildup plan.\nMcConnell conceded that GOP lawmakers as well as Democrats are troubled by Bush's new policy, but he said, \"Congress is completely incapable of dictating the tactics of the war.\"\nOptions for critics of the war to try forcing its end are limited, given the slim margin of Democratic control, especially in the Senate. But votes stating symbolic opposition to the troop buildup could embarrass many Republicans leery of supporting Bush's plan.\nRice appeared in the morning before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and in the afternoon before the House counterpart. She was grilled sharply by members of both parties.\nNot a single member of the Senate panel expressed outright support for the president's plan. One after another offered skepticism on various points \u2014 from the rationale for the war to al-Maliki's sincerity and resolve, from the need for additional troops to the administration's ruling out talking to Iran and Syria.\n\"You're going to have to do a much better job\" explaining the rationale for the war, \"and so is the president,\" said Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio. He said Mr. Bush could no longer count on his support for the war.\nRice acknowledged widespread skepticism among Americans. \"I want you to know that I understand and indeed feel the heartbreak that Americans feel at the continued sacrifice of American lives,\" she said.\nRice engaged several tense exchanges with members, including with Hagel, a Vietnam veteran and longtime critic of Bush's Iraq policy. She disputed his characterization of Bush's buildup as an \"escalation.\"\n\"Putting in 22,000 more troops is not an escalation?\" Hagel asked. Responded Rice: \"I think, senator, escalation is not just a matter of how many numbers you put in.\"\n\"Would you call it a decrease?\" Hagel asked.\n\"I would call it, senator, an augmentation that allows the Iraqis to deal with this very serious problem that they have in Baghdad,\" she said.\nWhen Rice disputed Hagel's contention that Iraq was in the throes of civil war, Hagel shot back: \"To sit there and say that, that's just not true.\"\nSaid Committee Chairman Joe Biden of Delaware: \"I believe the president's strategy is not a solution, Secretary Rice. I believe it's a tragic mistake.\"\nRice told senators there was a \"national imperative not to fail.\"\nThe Senate panel was flush with 2008 presidential hopefuls and possible contenders, including Hagel, Biden and Democrats John Kerry of Massachusetts, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Barack Obama of Illinois.\nMeanwhile, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another presidential hopeful, said after a meeting at the White House that he was concerned about al-Maliki's capabilities as well as \"whether these are sufficient number of troops.\"\nBut, he said, \"I do think we can succeed.\" McCain is among a handful of lawmakers who have called for more \u2014 not fewer \u2014 U.S. troops in Iraq.",

But after two years in that role she began questioning the path she was on, and set out to find a position that allowed for merit-based pay (i.e., \u201ceat-what-you-kill\u201d vs. salary + bonus).\nShe gave notice, but management surprised her by coming back with an offer that sounded interesting \u2013 they asked her to transition into a sales position, where she would be responsible for raising money from U.S. institutional investors. She soon became one of the top revenue generators for the firm. But over time she reached a point where no amount of compensation could justify how skewed her work/life balance was. Her near-constant travel made cultivating relationships difficult, and the initial thrill of being able to take expensive trips once a year had worn off. A key \u201caha moment\u201d came when her team called with news of closing a huge deal, and she found herself faking an enthusiastic response. She felt depressed, and knew something needed to change.\nCraving reconnecting with herself, she started a personal blog called Kathryn\u2019s Conversations as a hobby, where she talked about various topics that interested her, showcasing her keenly observant wit and rediscovering her love of storytelling. Friends and family were following along, but she knew how hard it was to make money on a personal blog, and that monetization wasn\u2019t a realistic option for her. As luck would have it, one day at her hair salon she began talking with a fellow customer who mentioned being a brand consultant. She asked Cicoletti all about herself, and later spent 15 coaching sessions with her. The result? Kathryn\u2019s Conversations was killed, bringing life to MakinSense Babe.\nThe problem Cicoletti observed throughout her time working in the financial sector was that people seemed to be unnecessarily complicating things \u2013 it was almost as if they used insider jargon intentionally to make themselves feel smarter, and more elite than the general population. This was limiting access to important information, and resulting in too much trust being put in those with questionable motives (we all know how that turned out). Cicoletti wanted to change that, but she couldn\u2019t leave her day job until she\u2019d saved enough money to cover at least one year of anticipated expenses. If you\u2019re like me you just read that and thought, \u201cBut she was averaging more than $500K per year! Didn\u2019t that provide enough cushion to quit right away?\u201d Nope, when questioned on this Cicoletti makes clear that her accumulated wealth was invested, and she wasn\u2019t about to start pulling from her 401K. It\u2019s appropriately financially responsible, and earns her even more credibility.\nIn May of 2013, even after her boss offered her the opportunity to take a one-year sabbatical, she officially broke free from her golden handcuffs and began working on MakinSense Babe full-time. She has an active following on Twitter and Facebook, distributes a weekly newsletter that never fails to entertain, and recently launched something she\u2019s calling \u201cThe Best F@#king Investment Cheat Sheet,\u201d which is a $10/month subscription service for those seeking a bit more detail on investment strategy in a digestible format. MakinSense Babe is most frequently compared to theSkimm, though Cicoletti sees her content as more of a compliment to generalized news curators, and is actively pursuing revenue sharing partnerships that allow her voice to reach a broader audience. \u201cRight now I\u2019m really excited about the videos I\u2019m creating with the help of Shtoops Productions,\u201d she says, \u201cWe are taking the humor to a whole other level, and we\u2019re working on creating more of a 'show' feeling with various segments.\u201d It\u2019s the first time she won\u2019t be doing all of the video editing, a task that has consumed an enormous amount of her time, but helped her to minimize operating expenses.",
        "The state will attempt to recoup some of its $44 million contract due to Questar's poor performance.\nComputer-based English language arts testing will partially resume Thursday for students across New York after software failures Tuesday and a one-day hiatus Wednesday, state Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia said.\nStudents in grades 5 and 8 can take online tests Thursday, but other grades will be staggered across the remaining open period for testing in order to avoid overloading the Questar Assessment Inc. software, which is now in its second year of inadequate performance.\n\"There is no excuse for the difficulties experienced by schools administering computer-based testing,\u201d Elia said in a statement. \"We are holding Questar accountable for its failure to deliver the services required in our contract with them.\"\nThis is the first week of testing for students in grades 3-8 for students across the state. About a quarter of them are taking their tests online rather than on paper.\nSchools are allowed to pick which days they use for testing during the week. As statewide participation surged Tuesday, the Questar software the state uses became overwhelmed and would not let students submit their work.\nAccording to the state Education Department, Questar concluded that its servers ran out of memory at the point when tens of thousands of students across the state were trying to log in or submit their results.\nStudents' work was saved on their computers, and the state said 84,000 students \u2014 about 93 percent of all test-takers \u2014 were able to submit their finished tests. But the state teachers union nonetheless called on the state to abandon computer-based testing until it can administer it with more confidence.\nIt is the third consecutive year of software glitches for Questar, which received a five-year, $45 million contract in 2015 from the state Education Department. Last year the software was swamped as well; in 2017, some students had their personal data exposed.\nThe state Education Department will review its contract with Questar to see whether it can levy any financial punishment for \"its failure to fulfill its contract to deliver reliable and seamless computer-based assessments in New York state.\" That includes considering canceling the contract, Elia said.\nAdditional paper tests also will be distributed to schools that prefer to switch to those.\nSchools have until April 12 to finish the two-day English language arts exams. Math tests will be administered in early May.\nQuestar said they take their responsibility \"...to provide accurate and insightful testing results seriously.\"",
        "The mayor and the governor go out for a movie date . . . to Fifty Shades of Grey.\nWell, I\u2019ve had some bad ideas in my day. I dressed as Madonna for Halloween one year in college (there are at least three remaining pictures out there, which I will track down and burn if it takes me the rest of my life). Once I drank four gallons of 7 Up in 15 minutes on a dare (this was pre-Chirlane, surprise surprise). But I think this one may have taken the proverbial cake: last night, I went to see Fifty Shades of Grey with Andrew Cuomo.\nI know, I know, I know. What was I thinking?! But hear me out. My aides sent me a link to all of his quotes from the other day. The guy said that our relationship would go down as the best between a mayor and governor in \u201cmodern political history,\u201d for God\u2019s sakes. I couldn\u2019t just not respond to that with a sloppy wet kiss in return (metaphorically), could I? So I had my aides send him an e-mail asking him if he wanted to get together for a beer, or some such show-of-good-faith, smile-for-the-cameras kind of thing. I wanted the full-on New York Post asking in its cover headline, \u201cWHEN ARE THEY GONNA SET UP THE REGISTRY?\u201d treatment.\nAnyway, I told my aide to ask Cuomo if he wanted to just see the goddamn thing with me, so that I didn\u2019t have to keep saying, \u201cNo comment,\u201d when people asked me what I thought of the movie. I had no idea what I was getting into. I sat down next to the guy in the theater, and he didn\u2019t even look up from his phone. So I decided to make a joke: \u201cNever imagined I\u2019d be seeing this with a dude, let alone a dude from Queens.\u201d He barely even smirked.\nI thought the movie was gonna be, you know, a little bit of dirty talk, maybe some heavy petting. Was not expecting to see a girl Chiara\u2019s age naked for the entire film, while this pasty popsicle stick of a man was parading around in his fancy jeans, glooming as if the world was about to end, wielding the kind of contraptions I\u2019d only ever seen in an auto mechanic\u2019s shop. When the lights came on, Cuomo and I didn\u2019t speak for what felt like five full minutes. \u201cI\u2019m one shade of disturbed,\u201d I finally said (my mother used to say, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you\u2019re good at, Billy, it\u2019s putting people at ease\u201d). \u201cI gotta get to a meeting,\u201d he mumbled, and left without even shaking my hand.\nYou know, it\u2019s all well and good to go tell this reporter and that blog that we\u2019re best buds, but you gotta walk that walk, too, then. If I learned anything from Fifty Shades of Grey, it\u2019s that the key to a good relationship is communication\u2014and the occasional experimental flogging. The Cuo-bro and I need to get the former down, and then maybe someday we\u2019ll get to the flogging.\nErm, you know what I mean.",
        "Now free from federal custory, Vick can lobby for a return to the field.\nFormer NFL star Michael Vick is a free man after serving his 23-month sentence for bankrolling a dog-fighting operation.\nBut it remains to be seen if the suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback will be able to return to the field. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Vick indefinitely prior to the 2007 season, and has not given any timetable for ruling on Vick's possible reinstatement, according to The Associated Press.\nIt is expected that Vick will soon sit down face-to-face with Goodell, who has said he would review Vick's status after he completed his federal sentence.\nGoodell's decision could go any number of ways, from extending Vick's suspension to allowing him back in the game immediately. Training camps open next weekend, so Goodell would have to act quickly to get Vick back in play for the coming season.\nIn nearly three years as commissioner, Goodell has taken a hard line against players who violate of the NFL's personal conduct policy, in hope of protecting the league's image. He has said that Vick must demonstrate genuine remorse to be reinstated.\nIt is also not clear whether any NFL team would even sign the free agent. In June, Atlanta Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff relinquished the team's contractual rights to Vick, saying that if he is returns to football, it would be with another club.\nVick, 29, spent most of his sentence behind bars in Leavenworth, Kan. For the past two months, however, he has been under home confinement wearing an electronic monitor and working a $10-an-hour job for a construction company in Hampton, Va. At the end of June, he gave up the construction job to be a program aide at the Boys & Girls Clubs.\nAnd he didn't just pay for his crime in time. Vick forfeited $70 million from a 10-year contract, lost millions in endorsements and paid $928,000 in restitution for the care of the victimized pit bulls. He's in bankruptcy proceedings to address more than $20 million in debt.\nVick will remain on probation for three years. He also is under a three-year suspended sentence for a state dogfighting conviction.",
        "Today, internet marketing research company comScore released a white paper detailing which Facebook features receive the most usage and where users interact with branded content. The report shows that 27% of Facebook browsing is on the news feed and home page \u2014 4% of all time spent online in the US. 21% of time was spent on profiles, 17% on Photos, 10% on applications, and 25% on the rest of the site. Most engagement with branded content happens on the news feed, not Pages, yet the average brand in the top 100 Facebook Pages reaches only 16% of their fans per week if they post five days a week.\nThese stats should illuminate that brands should put more effort into optimizing their news feed posts than developing apps for their Pages if they want to reach the most people. The report is based on a two million person opt-in panel of web internet users that agreed to be monitored, so the sample size is ample though it might skew towards savvier, less skittish users.\nFacebook\u2019s Photos feature is often considered a core driver of time spent on Facebook. ComScore\u2019s stats showing more usage of the news feed than Photos don\u2019t necessarily disprove this, as time spent reading news feed stories and notifications generated by photo uploads and tags are counted towards the news feed\u2019s time. Facebook has yet to develop other features as popular as the news feed or Photos.\nSome might expect that applications and games would take up more than 10% of user time. In September 2010, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said over 200 million people, or roughly 40% of users were playing games on Facebook when the service had 500 million users, and that stat might still hold true. A few months prior, Playdom CEO cited undisclosed personal sources saying 40% of all time on Facebook was spent on games \u2014 a much higher percentage than comScore\u2019s figures. These new stats should serve as a reality check that brands shouldn\u2019t be too focused on building tab applications or marketing within social games.\nComScore\u2019s data supports a similar conclusion as findings by Facebook Page analytics tool provider PageLever, which showed that the average Facebook Page receives an average of just 7.49 news feed post impressions and only 3.19 unique Page views per day per 100 fans. Essentially, each post a Page publishes only reaches a small fraction of its total fans via the news feed, and an even smaller portion of its fans visit the Page itself.\nPages that want to increase the percentage of their fans which they reach with news feed posts should make sure to post every day. A study of the top 100 Pages showed that for each additional day per week that a Page posts, it reaches 2.5% more of its fan base. Those that post every day can reach as much of 22% of their fan base each week.\nA study of three popular brands on Facebook, Starbucks, Bing, and Southwest Airlines, showed that they saw 40 to 151 times more impressions in the news feed than on their Pages. While this study only had three data points, marketers should take note of the disproportionate amount of exposure that occurs in the news feed. This is partly because re-shares of news feed posts by a Page\u2019s fans help drive news feed exposure.\nComScore\u2019s white paper also stresses that a great deal of potential for exposure lies in the friends of a brand\u2019s current fans. If Pages can post content compelling enough that fans are willing to re-share it, they can reach a huge new audience. This is because Facebook has said for years that the average user has 130 friends, though we\u2019ve heard that could be closer to 170 now. ComScore\u2019s report shows that the total count of the friends of fans of Facebook\u2019s most popular Pages is on average 31 to 84 times higher than the fan counts of those Pages.\nFor Page posting strategy tips that can help you leverage your existing fan base and gain new Likes, visit the Facebook Marketing Bible, Inside Network\u2019s complete guide to marketing and advertising through Facebook.",
        "With grant money expected to drop by more than $1.2 million next year, Mendon-Upton school officials hope to provide a level-service budget by increasing their funding request to the two towns.\nThe Mendon-Upton Regional School Committee held a public hearing last night at which they voted to request a $28.39 million operating budget for fiscal 2012, an 8.47 percent increase over this year's $26.18 million operating budget.\nAbout 80 residents attended the public hearing, many with questions about what the budget would mean for classes, athletics and the Spanish immersion program.\n\"We're hoping this will be successful,\" Superintendent Antonio Fernandes said. \"But keep in mind that in order to have a level-service budget, this does require additional funding from both towns above the required contribution.\"\nUpton's contribution would increase 16.95 percent from $7.39 million this year to $8.64 million. Funding from Mendon would increase 14.95 percent from $6.2 million to $7.13 million.\nThe rest of the education revenue would come from the state and other sources.\nFernandes said he was \"optimistic\" that both towns will provide the needed funding. School officials did not identify where it would come from.\nUpton officials have previously looked toward the town's school stabilization account as a possible funding source. Officials from Mendon have discussed a possible Proposition 2 1/2 property tax override.\n\"We're not asking the towns how they're going to get there,\" said School Committee Vice Chairwoman Heather Applegate. \"We're not asking for any more specifics on how the administration is going to use resources.\n\"Right now the School Committee is charged with voting on our final budget request,\" she said.\nApplegate said the district has pursued several cost-saving measures in recent years, including sharing costs with other districts, increasing energy efficiency and acquiring grants.\nThe district has also cut 57 teachers, cut programs and eliminated funding for athletics and other student activities.\nApplegate proposed adding a new behavioral program that would cost about $140,000 and include an adjustment counselor, a dual certified special education/general education teacher and two aides. She said such a program could reduce special education costs by keeping students within the district and possibly attracting students from nearby towns.\nUpton resident Michelle Goodwin said she appreciated school officials' optimism in getting the needed funding.\n\"I'm glad it looks like it's going to go well this year,\" she said. \"However I would like to see the real picture. What are we talking about for loss of teachers, other staff, class sizes, etc.?\"\nFernandes said the level-service budget maintains what the school district currently has.\nIf there is no funding to offset the $1.2 million grant reduction, part of which was due to the end of federal stimulus funding and part was from a separate federal Education Jobs Bill, the district would face staff reductions similar to last year's 33.25 positions cut. Class sizes would increase to the high 20s or low 30s.\nThe proposed budget does not include any increases to the Spanish immersion program, said Fernandes, who noted that the School Committee will soon discuss whether to open up the School Choice program, in which students go to a school in a different town, to kindergartners.\nKelly Carey of Upton said there are many parents whose children are not in the Spanish immersion program and feel left out, particularly after the world language program was cut at the middle school.\n\"I just want to make sure that we're looking out for all the kids when we are thinking about the programs we offered,\" Carey said.\nOther attendees asked if the district is looking at what they will be faced with next year.\nSchool Committee Chairman Don Morin said the schools will no longer be relying on one-time grants because they are gone for fiscal year 2012.\n\"Until the economy turns around and the state is able to provide more funding, I'm not sure what the future looks like,\" he said.\nThe School Committee meets again on April 4.",
        "LIVELY is a new online lingerie company that combines the style of traditional lingerie with the comfort of athleisure.\nAdding to its collection of affordable bras ($35), underwear ($10), and swimwear ($45+), LIVELY released a new wireless, strapless bra ($35) that was met with great enthusiasm and is already backordered.\nThough it's not perfect, we found it was a big improvement from the uncomfortable strapless bras we're used to wearing. That the bra manages to provide comfort and support while being wire-free is impressive.\nStrapless bras are the bane of every woman's existence. In an incredible feat of engineering and daring, most strapless bras manage to simultaneously dig into your skin and slip down your chest every few minutes. I personally stopped wearing strapless tops and dresses altogether to avoid this uncomfortable reality. Other times, I've decide I simply don't care enough that my straps are showing.\nFor years, I had to choose between subtlety and comfort, but I recently tried a strapless bra that didn't compromise, and is completely affordable to boot.\nOnline lingerie startup LIVELY launched just two years ago in 2016 behind the leadership of Victoria's Secret veteran Michelle Cordeiro Grant, selling supportive and stylish bras for only $35. From the beginning, strapless bras were in high demand so the company started offering smooth and lace strapless bras the following year.\nNow, LIVELY has made a strapless bra that's still offers shape and support, but without the pesky wires. The new No-Wire Strapless Bra can even be bent and rolled up, without affecting its shape, for easy packing.\nThe No-Wire Strapless comes in two solid, neutral colors, Toasted Almond and Jet Black. It's lightly lined with foam padding and the back closure has four hooks for extra security, while the band is a breathable mesh fabric. Since there's no wire, the bra derives its support from the back closure and the structured sides where the cups meet the mesh band.\nI approached the bra with understandable skepticism, but came away happily surprised after wearing it under various shirts and dresses. Made with 85% nylon and 15% spandex, it's soft and also stretchy enough to give just the right amount of wiggle room without any gapping. I wasn't used to dealing with so many hooks in the back, but the extra hooks ultimately played an important role in keeping the bra up.\nThough I could still tell I was wearing a strapless bra throughout the day, I certainly thought of it much less often than I usually do because it wasn't painful to wear and I didn't have to constantly wriggle around self-consciously to readjust its position. Instead, I could carry on with my day, supported yet undistracted.\nI hate strapless bras \u2014 and I pretty much always have. But this LIVELY bra is one of the good ones; I actually, somehow, don't mind wearing it \u2014 and it has sufficient support (even sans underwire) to accommodate a 32DD/34D. It has a no-slip strip that works without leaving me feeling like I've been segmented with cable wires to withstand gravity and motion.\nThe adjustable, removable straps mean I've even found myself turning to this bra for its stability in my every day life, thanks to that no-slip strip and a blessed four level hook-and-eye back closure I'm always excited to see. I wish it didn't have the noticeable seam in the front, because it makes it difficult to wear under sheer or light-colored shirts, but, all in all, for $35 this is still one of the most comfortable and supportive strapless bras I've found. I would have paid more.\nAdmittedly, the wireless bra isn't perfect: it could be more size-inclusive (sizes currently range from 32A to 38DD) and as Mara mentions, the front seam can show through a thin white t-shirt or other thin materials like a silk slip dress.\nHowever, overall it definitely exceeded my expectations by being more comfortable and supportive than any other strapless bra I've tried. At $35, it's also a great value buy, which LIVELY makes even more affordable by allowing you to mix and match two bras for $55 or three bras for $75.",

        "WASHINGTON (CN) \u2013 Republicans heaped ridicule on Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood at a Wednesday hearing after LaHood suggested that bicycling and walking are just as good ways to get around as cars. To laughter, Republican House members suggested LaHood was taking drugs, dismissed the very idea of bike lanes and derided any change to a car-dependent society. \u201cWhat job is going to be created by having a bike lane?\u201d asked Ohio Republican Steven LaTourette.\nHe suggested that environmental sustainability projects have \u201cstolen\u201d $300 million from other programs and to attacked LaHood\u2019s encouragement of bicycling, on a personal level. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a typo, is there still mandatory drug-testing at the department?\u201d said the wit, to chuckles from the back of the room.\nThe brouhaha over LaHood\u2019s statements on his Web site came up in the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.\nCongress is reviewing the $75.3 billion transportation budget request for fiscal year 2011.\nWith a new focus on livability and environmental sustainability, the department plans to funnel $1 billion of the new budget to high-speed passenger rail and $1.6 billion for government-owned Amtrak, which primarily carries freight.\nTestifying at the hearing, Roy Kienitz, Under Secretary of the Transportation Department, said the administration is considering a shift from highway to water and rail for freight, as more fuel-efficient than trucks. The department plans to invest $57 million in water transport.\nKienitz said that transportation funding has changed under a program authorized by the Recovery Act last year. Each freight transportation mode has largely been funded from its own trust fund, in some cases drawing only on private money for projects that benefit the public, Kienitz said.\n\u201cInvestments have been dictated by where the funding came from rather than where the investments could have the greatest impact on the desired outcomes,\u201d he said.\nBy increasing federal funds, as opposed to relying so heavily on trust funds, the government has been able to develop important areas of transportation that are otherwise overlooked, like the short but over-used corridors between ports and highways.\nIn selecting projects, the department says it is prioritizing environmental sustainability, livability, safety, economic competitiveness and state of good repair.\nKienitz also noted that the department still performs drug tests.",

        "SEOUL (Reuters) - The one certainty in unpredictable North Korea is that if the state detonates a nuclear device or leader Kim Jong-il visits a duck farm, Ri Chun-hee will be on TV boasting about the amazing accomplishment.\nRi is the forceful grandmother speaking with the authority of the state as the main newscaster for North Korea\u2019s only TV channel. Her face is one of the few broadcast abroad and her stentorian reports thunder across airwaves from the land where leader Kim rarely speaks.\nRi, born in 1943, is an actress turned newscaster who first took to the air in 1971 when the North\u2019s state TV channel was taking off.\nSlightly plump, with permed black hair, she has become an institution whose bombastic delivery decries the miseries inflicted upon the state by a hostile world while celebrating its military triumphs.\n\u201cWith her rusty voice that is powerful and appealing, what could the 65-year-old Ri have gone through to become the people\u2019s broadcaster and hardworking hero?,\u201d the North\u2019s Chosun Monthly magazine asked in an article last year.\nKim pushed her to be a broadcaster with fiery speech, the magazine said in one of the few North Korean news stories giving details of her life.\n\u201cWhen Ri announced reports and statements, enemies would tremble in fear,\u201d it added.\nExperts in the North\u2019s ideology said she is akin to a high priestess of the state\u2019s propaganda apparatus who cannot be avoided in the hermit country where TV sets turn on and off but cannot change channel.\nOver the years, she has denounced South Korea, Japan and the United States with frequency as she delivered news of the North\u2019s two nuclear tests.

        "According to Beilock, the newly created Barnard Community Safety Group\u2014a group of students, faculty, staff, and outside experts\u2014will conduct a review of Public Safety policies.\nFollowing the physical confrontation of Alexander McNab, CC \u201919, by Barnard Public Safety earlier this week, Barnard will undertake a review of training for Public Safety officers and convene a Community Safety Group, Barnard President Sian Beilock announced in an email sent to students Sunday night.\nThe announcement comes after an incident on Thursday night where Barnard Public Safety officers followed McNab into the Milstein Center for Teaching and Learning and pinned him against a counter in Peet\u2019s Coffee after he did not show his student ID at the Barnard gates. The officers then confiscated his ID, saying they needed to verify that he was an active Columbia student. Videos of the confrontation circulated widely on social media over the weekend, and students also held demonstrations condemning anti-blackness and Public Safety on Friday night and Sunday morning.\nDuring a listening session hosted by Barnard on Friday, administrators stated that the six officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave. Beilock announced in her email that an independent firm has been hired to investigate the incident, and will issue a report on the origins and escalation of the confrontation and make recommendations for future action. The report will be made public.\nThe email was the first from the Barnard administration to explicitly acknowledge the physical confrontation of McNab and disavow racism on Barnard\u2019s campus in relation to the incident, though she did not explicitly state that Public Safety\u2019s confrontation with McNab was anti-black. In contrast, communications from the deans of Columbia College, Columbia Engineering, and General Studies on Friday pointed to connections with police violence and anti-blackness.\nAccording to Beilock, the newly created Barnard Community Safety Group\u2014a group of students, faculty, staff, and outside experts\u2014will conduct a review of Public Safety policies, their equal enforcement, and transparency surrounding them. In an interview with Spectator on April 12, McNab stated that he felt the rule of showing a Barnard or Columbia ID to enter Barnard\u2019s campus after 11 p.m. had been applied unequally for white students in contrast with students of color.\nConcerns around the nebulous role of Public Safety officers on campus were also raised at a recent Barnard Student Government Association meeting in March, wherein Public Safety Executive Director Antonio Gonzalez stated that Public Safety officers act as civilians on campus and have no authority over students that is comparable to that of the New York Police Department or any other police force.\nAdditionally, the college will be undertaking a review of training procedures for all Public Safety officers and supervisors with the intent of ensuring policies are enforced equally \u201cregardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or national origin\u201d while the independent investigation is ongoing.\nThe email also referenced long-term initiatives that the college is undertaking to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion on campus, including the imminent hiring of a vice president of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and a series of open forums on inclusivity. The first forum, hosted by the Consortium for Critical Interdisciplinary Studies, will be held on Tuesday, April 16, and aims to place the confrontation with McNab in Barnard\u2019s historical and structural context.\nThe past few days have been very distressing for our entire community. The confrontation with a black male Columbia University student and several Barnard public safety officers on April 11, 2019, does not reflect the values of the College; what transpired was unacceptable and antithetical to our mission. I am as deeply troubled by what we witnessed in those videos as you are.\nI sincerely apologize to the Columbia student involved and have reached out to him to better understand his experience on campus. I also apologize to the students who witnessed it and were treated disrespectfully, and to all who have felt its impact.\nThe confrontation puts into stark relief what some members of the Barnard College community, particularly people of color, have been saying about their relationship with the Office of Public Safety and the lack of trust they have in it to keep them safe. We must ensure that public safety officers act equitably toward all and that the community trusts this will occur. That work is now underway, effective immediately.\nSince Thursday evening, we have also heard from many members of the Barnard community and beyond. I want to thank those who attended our Friday listening session and those who reached out to share your thoughts and experiences; we welcome any additional thoughts on this critical topic. What has come across is a pervasive sense that racial bias remains pernicious on our campus. In particular, people of color have expressed to me feeling excluded or singled out in campus life, in the classroom, and, yes, in dealings with public safety. I want to say directly that I hear you and am committed to change.\nBarnard is about academic excellence, which cannot occur without diversity and an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome and safe. Moving forward, the College has taken, and will continue to take, a number of steps toward that goal \u2013 beginning but not ending with a focus on campus security.\nFirst, we promptly placed all of the public safety officers and the supervisor involved on administrative leave pending the outcome of an independent investigation.\nSecond, an independent firm is being hired to thoroughly investigate everything that happened on April 11, and will issue a report on how and why the situation began and escalated, with recommendations for moving forward. The findings will help us evaluate our Office of Public Safety and will be shared publicly.\nThird, we are undertaking a thorough review of how all public safety officers and supervisors are trained. Our values demand that all members of our community be treated equally and with respect. All policies must be clear and equitably enforced regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or national origin. While the investigator\u2019s review is underway, these expectations are being reinforced across campus.\nFourth, it is essential that we engage in an honest, ongoing dialogue with students, faculty, and staff about how public safety is conducted on campus. The events of Thursday evening underscore the need for both a comprehensive evaluation of the rules that govern public safety on Barnard\u2019s campus, and the methods of communicating these rules and applying them equally. Therefore, I am assembling a Barnard Community Safety Group that will be chaired by Molree Williams-Lendor, our Executive Director of Equity. The Barnard Community Safety Group will include students, faculty, staff, and bring in outside expertise as needed. A list of the Barnard Community Safety Group\u2019s members and its charge will be posted shortly on barnard.edu. The Barnard Community Safety Group will meet in the coming days to discuss community concerns around public safety, and review and assess current policies, making sure they are transparent and equitably enforced. The Barnard Community Safety Group will also serve as a forum for public safety officers and supervisors to test ideas and receive feedback, helping to create necessary dialogue between the Office of Public Safety and the Barnard community to ensure direct input into what campus safety looks like and means at Barnard.\nFifth, the reality is that conversations about race, racial bias, and racial profiling need to take place, and I acknowledge that Barnard College must participate authentically in this vital dialogue\u2014including me. I want to be clear that racism has no place on our campus. We have recognized this need in our continued work with the College\u2019s Council on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), in preparation for the imminent hiring of a Vice President of DEI, who will report directly to me and be part of my senior team. This soon-to-be-announced Vice President will chair the DEI Council and work closely with the Dean for Faculty Diversity and Development.\nAs part of our commitment to the long-term actions necessary to rewrite histories of inequity, we will have open forums in the weeks ahead in order to foster a heartfelt exchange of ideas and experiences that can move us toward the diverse, inclusive and equitable community we strive to be. The first inclusive community forum will take place Tuesday, April 16, at 6:30 PM, in Altschul 202. It will be hosted by the Consortium for Critical Interdisciplinary Studies (CCIS), a collaboration between Africana Studies, American Studies, and Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies. CCIS\u2019 aim is to discuss the place of Thursday night\u2019s events within the structures and histories of which Barnard is a part. I will be attending and hope to hear more from the community on Tuesday.\nThere is work to be done and I look forward to continuing that work with all of you.\nStaff writer Heather Loepere can be contacted at heather.loepere@columbiaspectator.com.

        "Two science fiction movies go head-to-head, one starring Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, the other Gerard Butler and Andy Garcia. If you had to bet money on which would outgross the other, you'd surely put your money on Ford and Gosling, confident you'd win that bet.\nAnd that's just what happened with Blade Runner 2049 and Geostorm in North America. The Ford-Gosling starring sequel to the 1982 Ridley Scott classic earned $12.6 million on its opening day, three times as much as the $4.3 million earned in its debut by the Butler-starring Geostorm. In most territories, the former film will easily wind up outgrossing the latter.\nNow, take those same two movies and release them in China. Without making any meaningful changes to either picture, you adjust the poster for Geostorm by removing Butler and Garcia's names and images and replacing them with another actor who isn't even billed on the U.S. poster: Daniel Wu.\nChinese posters for 'Geostorm' and 'Blade Runner 2049.\nAnd voil\u00e0, with that adjustment in the marketing, you\u2019ve changed everything. When Geostorm opened on Friday against Blade Runner 2049, it outearned the more well-received Ford-Gosling picture by a margin of four-to-one, $10 million to just $2.4 million.\n'Geostorm' debuted in China on October 27, 2017.\nButler and Garcia are barely known in China, but Wu, who was born in Berkeley, California, is a big star there. The son of immigrants from Shanghai, the 43-year-old Wu grew up in California admiring Jet Li and Jackie Chan. After graduating from the University of Oregon, he moved to Hong Kong in 1997, initially to pursue a modeling career.\nOnly four months later, the Hong Kong martial arts movie director Yonfan contacted Wu after seeing his image on a bus stop advertisement and asked him to star in his upcoming film Bishonen. Despite the fact that he did not speak Cantonese, Wu performed in the picture and was on his way to a successful career as an action star.\nBased ever since in Hong Kong and mainland China, Wu has since appeared in over 60 films, including the hit Overheard movies, Go Away Mr. Tumor and Warcraft.\nWhen Geostorm director Dean Devlin cast Wu, he did so not only for the award-winning actor's on-screen talent but also for his marquee value in China, where the picture was expected to perform well given the prior success with disaster movies as The Day After Tomorrow and 2012.\nIn contrast to the cynical Hollywood casting of Chinese stars in tiny cameo roles, to which Chinese audiences often react with well-deserved sneers, casting Wu in Geostorm was a well-considered move that has paid off nicely. Though it's impossible to say how much impact Wu has had on the bottom line, it's safe to say that his presence in has been vastly more important to Geostorm's China results than Gerard Butler or any of the picture's other actors.",
        "Some of the children awaiting to be adopted play with toys at Alice Adoption Home in Westcliff. Western Cape minister of social development, Albert Fritz, has condemned the \"steam rolling\" of recent amendments to the Children's Act. Picture: Bonile Bam.\nCape Town - On 25 February 2019, the South African Government Gazette listed the National Department of Social Development\u2019s notice of intention to introduce the Children\u2019s Amendment Bill of 2019 into the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces.\nThe Western Cape Minister of Social Development, Albert Fritz, has condemned the notice of intention to introduce the Children\u2019s Amendment Bill.\nThe amendments to sections 249 and 259 of Children\u2019s Act will effectively put an end to adoptions in South Africa as accredited child protection organisations, adoptive social workers, lawyers, psychologists and other associated professionals will not be able to charge for their expertise - including being unable to reclaim costs.\n\"Whilst a partial truth has been reported that the state will absorb the work of doing adoptions; the reality is that its social workers will not have the time to facilitate adoption since they are unable to keep pace with the basic demand for emergency temporary safe care and foster care services.\n\"At present, there is a high court order compelling the National Minister, Susan Shabangu, to resolve this situation by November 2019; an order which the current legislative amendments are supposed to address. Instead, the intended amendments will make matters even worse,\" Fritz said.\nSouth African social workers have exceedingly high caseloads, well over 100 on average, despite South African norms and standards recommending a maximum of 60. Social workers in developed countries like the UK and US have far less, at around 20 to 30 children per social worker.\n\u201cI call on all professional bodies, religious groups, child protection organisations, NPOs and civil society to speak up against these amendments so that no child is denied an opportunity to a loving and caring home.\n\u201cIn a country with an estimated 3.7 million orphaned and vulnerable children, legislation should facilitate the seamless adoption of children,\" Fritz said.",
        "Pastors John Gray, Steven Furtick, A.R. Bernard, Levi Lusko and Ken Claytor talk about race and culture and what churches should be doing.\nCategory Killer may be Pastor John Gray's new nickname.\nIt's because of Gray's work in bridging divides, work that includes going to places where people haven't seen a lot of diversity, said Pastor Steven Furtick, who gave his friend the new nickname during a racial healing event at Gray's Relentless Church in Greenville on Wednesday.\n\"God has used you to break barriers,\" said Furtick, lead pastor of Elevation Church in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nThe conversation was recorded and will be released as a movie in theaters across the country, possibly early next year.\nGray said he always looks to make himself personally uncomfortable, because it leads to growth. One way to grow, and to be uncomfortable, is to charge head-on into differences like when he signed onto work with the Rev. Joel Osteen or when he seeks out the whitest churches possible, such as Pastor Levi Lusko's Montana church.\n\"I know I've been places where I'm the first black man they've hugged,\" Gray said.\nLusko, one of the panelists, said his church recently uncovered World War II era advertisements while renovating, one of the ads promoted a KKK gathering at the former theater where he now leads worship services.\nBringing Gray to speak on a stage where hatred once reigned is one of those small steps, he said.\nHealing racial problems in the country will require people to meet more people, to do hard and slow work to build bridges, Lusko said.\nBuilding the Brooklyn Bridge took years and cost lives and treasure but it was overbuilt before the era of cars and can now handle the biggest SUVs. So too should churches overbuild the bridges between race, cultures, wealth and other differences, Lusko said.\nGray launched The Bridge on Wednesday, a new program that he hopes will continue conversations about race, culture and politics with the church at the front.\n\"Tonight our nation gets what I believe is the beginning of something I think will change the nation,\" Gray said. \"It's time for the church to have a necessary, uncomfortable conversation.\"\nChurches have not been intentional about growing diversity and good intentions have not led to a big enough change in what the Rev. Martin Luther King called the most segregated hour of the week, church on Sundays, Gray said.\nIt won't be easy, said Pastor Ken Claytor, of Alive Church in Gainsville, Florida.\nHe took over as pastor with a church that was 99 percent black and it took years of deliberate work, inviting people into his figurative and sometimes literal refrigerator, to get the church to a mix of people that reflects heaven's diversity.\n\"Diversity takes effort,\" Claytor said.\nIt's worth the effort because the nation is hurting right now and churches need to step up, Gray said.\nThe pastor has landed in Greenville by God's will and talking frankly about race will help expose racism for the evil it is, said Prophetess Sandra Campbell, who attends Redemption.\nThe church feels like what heaven should feel like, said Tiffany Mashburn, who has been attending the church since 2010, when it was called Redemption Church before Gray assumed the pastor's role in May.\n\"You tend to hear a lot of time that people go to the church that preaches the Jesus that's most comfortable for you but when you go you should be challenged,\" she said. \"This is what heaven would look like as opposed to a white church here and a black church there.\"\nAs the program ended, Alex Dodd jumped so high he nearly clicked his heels together.\nIt was exciting, said Dodd, who attends NewSpring Church in Clemson when he's at college there and Monaghan Baptist in Berea when he's at home.\n\"It's cool people from all over Greenville can come to one place and can start a conversation,\" he said.\nRacial healing and getting together to build bridges is just what Dodd was hoping to hear.\n\"Let's start that conversation,\" he said.",
        "Is Incentive Compensation a True Motivator?\nI write about compensation governance.\n\u201cPay for performance\u201d \u2013 the concept that executives\u2019 compensation should be commensurate with the value they deliver to shareholders \u2013 has become a household phrase in recent years. The popular understanding of its meaning reflects the longstanding belief in corporate America that financial incentives are the most powerful motivator of executive performance.\nYet the findings of various studies by behavioral psychologists suggest otherwise. These findings have profound implications for companies large and small, for they raise questions about the motivational rationale underlying incentive compensation programs.\nIn the 1950s, researcher Harry Harlow observed the behavior of monkeys performing relatively complex tasks. Based on these observations, Harlow postulated that the very performance of these tasks was its own reward \u2013 that the monkeys were driven by \u201cintrinsic motivation.\u201d Unfortunately, Harlow did not pursue his remarkable discovery any further \u2013 perhaps because it was too threatening to 1950s beliefs about motivating people with \u201cextrinsic\u201d rewards, otherwise known as money. Starting then and continuing to the present, corporate America has institutionalized a system of incentive compensation supported not by behavioral studies, but by finance research. Extrinsic financial rewards to executives have increased at escalating rates, far surpassing the growth in a typical worker\u2019s pay.\nNearly half a century after Harlow, psychological researchers comprehensively analyzed the results of 128 laboratory studies into the relationships between incentives, motivation and performance. Their findings concerning intrinsic motivation not only confirmed Harlow\u2019s, but also showed that incentive-based (extrinsic) rewards can have the net effect of actually lowering performance.\nSubsequent research over the past decade, most of it conducted in laboratory settings, also has found that incentives can limit or impair performance, particularly in situations requiring creativity and innovation. Summarizing the thrust of these findings in Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us (Riverhead Books, 2009), author Daniel Pink outlines the potential unintended consequences of using monetary incentives: extinguishing intrinsic motivation, diminishing performance, crushing creativity, encouraging unethical behavior and fostering short-term thinking.\nBehavioral researchers have found that external incentives can work against the inherent motivator of autonomy, our basic need to feel that we are in charge of our own destiny. Autonomy, relatedness (connection with others) and competence (a sense of mastery, accomplishment and achievement) are the core human needs and key intrinsic motivators at the heart of what is known as self-determination theory (SDT).\nIf the intrinsic motivators comprised by SDT are indeed critical to performance, one might ask, why haven\u2019t they figured more prominently in corporate compensation programs? Why have companies instead put so much emphasis on extrinsic rewards? In formulating compensation programs, companies have relied not on psychological studies, but on research from the fields of accounting and finance. This research has been grounded in agency theory, which seeks to solve what is known as the agency problem: that company owners and agents who work for them (management), don\u2019t have the same economic interests, so the solution is to use incentives to align management\u2019s interests with those of shareholders. SDT implicitly challenges the rationale of basing incentive compensation plans largely or wholly on agency theory.\nOf course, just because incentive compensation may be addictive doesn\u2019t mean that it is necessarily ineffective at boosting performance in some circumstances; it might people to do things they wouldn\u2019t otherwise want to do because they lack intrinsic motivation for the tasks in question. In fact, much of the research shows that extrinsic rewards are most effective in getting people to do repetitive, well defined tasks, or things they otherwise would not find personal meaning or value in doing.\nRegardless, Suvorov\u2019s findings have compensation governance implications: They may partially explain the escalation in executive compensation over the last 20 to 30 years. Further, his findings may in part account for the increasing disparity between senior executives\u2019 compensation and that of the average worker. Higher-level managers and executives receive a greater proportion of their total compensation comprised by incentives; feeding an addiction to incentive rewards would widen this disparity.\nHowever, the larger issue is how to provide effective intrinsic motivation and tap the true creative and innovative power of individuals and organizations. SDT research shows that people perform much better when they feel that their personal values and ideals are aligned with those of their organization, and where they derive meaning from pursuing the company\u2019s mission. They also perform better when they feel a connection with other people and in environments where they develop a sense of mastery or competence.\nThis implies that companies that value creativity and innovation should have a meaningful and clearly articulated purpose and mission, and should hire and promote people who are in tune with that purpose. It suggests that camaraderie, teamwork and employee development are more critical to performance than lucrative monetary incentives.\nHowever, people do work for money and most of us enjoy spending it, so a combination of monetary rewards and the softer motivational tools may be most effective. In the real world, the line between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation may not be a bright as it is for psychologists studying discrete phenomena in laboratories where all variables are known and quantified.\nNevertheless, the research findings raise provocative questions about the effectiveness of financial incentives as drivers of performance. By adroitly applying the findings, companies might be able to craft more nuanced, less formulaic compensation programs that are better suited to their needs and more effective at creating shareholder value.",

Or, perhaps you\u2019re a night owl who struggles with early Monday morning meetings. Whatever the case may be, restricting your Google calendar to specific work hours has never been easy \u2014 there\u2019s always that one coworker who sees an opening at 8 a.m. and takes it.\nFortunately, Google is adding a new set of controls to Calendar that will make it easier to set limits on your availability. In the coming weeks, a new feature will roll out that lets you customize your working hours on a day-to-day basis. Anyone who tries to send a meeting invite that falls outside of your hours will receive a note letting them know you might decline.\nAlthough you can currently set one default working hour timeframe for Monday through Friday, the new tool enables more daily specificity. So, if you need to leave early every Monday but can stay a little later on Tuesdays you can change your hours to reflect that distinction.\nAnother new feature, \u201cout of office\u201d, serves a similar purpose. Instead of blocking off your calendar with a fake event to preserve one blessed, meeting-free hour, you can set an \u201cout of office\u201d entry. Anyone who tries to invite you to an event during that time will receive an automatic decline and you can personalize the message that goes with it.\nBoth updates come as part of the \u201cdigital well-being \u201d movement that\u2019s sweeping Silicon Valley. The hypocrisy of this is not lost on anyone \u2014 tech introduced many of the distractions it\u2019s now seeking to course-correct \u2014 but the benefits of scheduling an \u201cout of office\u201d timeframe and working hours may have far-reaching effects.\nConstant connectivity produced a culture where employees are always \u201con\u201d, whether you\u2019re active on Slack or not. The visual reinforcement of working hours and \u201cout of office\u201d could help signify that the end of workday really is the end of your workday. Of course, the reality is there may be times you need to deviate \u2014 a long-term project can call for a late night here or there to meet a deadline \u2014 but the intention is there, and that\u2019s what matters.

        "When broadband goes down, these two routers allow for an analog-modem backup.\nWhat happens if your broadband connection goes down and your business depends on it? How easily can you hook up and use a dial-up modem for each PC? And what if you can't yet get broadband service but still want a residential gateway, including hardware-based routing and firewall protection? The D-Link DI-714 Wireless Broadband Router ($220 street) and the U.S. Robotics Broadband Router ($150) address these problems by adding analog modem support to the usual list of residential gateway features: a single RJ-45 for a WAN (cable or DSL modem) connection, a four-port 10/100 Ethernet switch, support for NAT and DHCP, internal firewalls, various security features, and Web browser configuration. The D-Link model adds an internal 802.11b wireless access point; the U.S. Robotics model has a printer port to use in conjunction with print server software to install on each network PC.\nWhat sets these two gateways apart is that each also includes a 9-pin serial port for attaching an external analog modem if broadband isn't available.\nInstalling the residential gateways was simple. Also, the D-Link start-up brochure is a model of completeness and clarity.\nThe two gateways worked fine with our multiple-technology and -brand test network, which used an SNET DSL modem for broadband and a new U.S. Robotics V.92 56K Faxmodem ($110 street) plugged into each gateway's serial port.\nThe D-Link model can have both the cable/DSL modem and the analog modem plugged in at the same time; both are configured from the same setup screen. If broadband service fails (we simulated this by pulling the power plug), the analog modem automatically dials your ISP. On our test, the unit worked perfectly. The U.S. Robotics model, however, can not accommodate both modem types at the same time. If your broadband service goes out, you have to unplug the WAN plug, plug in the analog modem, reconfigure the router software for dial-up access, and reboot the router. This works, but we prefer the automatic process.\nYou may not want to pay for a wired ISP dial-up account if you're already paying for broadband, but if staying connected is essential, these two broadband routers make having both a viable option.",

        "Wendell Pritchett, 87, a classical pianist, public school teacher, and father of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s first African American provost, died Saturday, April 6, at the hospice at the University of Pennsylvania.\nThe cause was complications related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, his son, also named Wendell, said.\nHe was born April 22, 1931, in Philadelphia and grew up in Darby, according to his family. He graduated from Temple University with bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in music before receiving a doctorate in music education from Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Pritchett taught at several schools, including West Philadelphia High School, and directed the Philadelphia School District\u2019s music program before retiring in 1993, said his wife of 55 years, Carolyn.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Dr. Pritchett conducted the All-City High School Music Festival, an annual showcase of hundreds of the city\u2019s top young musicians and singers, his family said.\nThe classical pianist also conducted choirs with Grammy Award-winning pianist Peter Nero and the Philly Pops, his son said. Dr. Pritchett taught and mentored top musicians including Kenny Gamble, Christian McBride, and Joey DeFrancesco. In the early 1980s, he served as director of the Germantown branch of Settlement Music School and chairman of the board of Opera Ebony in Philadelphia.\nOne of Dr. Pritchett\u2019s favorite musicians was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, the 19th-century Polish composer of Romantic-era music, Carolyn Pritchett said. His son, Wendell, added that his father had a penchant for the dramatic, always opting to play German composer Robert Schumann\u2019s Widmung (\u201cdedication\u201d). He played this song at his son\u2019s wedding.\nDr. Pritchett\u2019s family also worked in education. His wife was a high school English teacher at Philadelphia High School for Girls in the 1970s and the High School for Creative & Performing Arts from 1978 to 1993. She met her husband at West Philadelphia High School in the late 1950s when she had her first assignment as an English teacher and he was a music teacher.\nSon Wendell became Penn\u2019s first African American provost in 2017. Before taking the No. 2 post at the Ivy League school, he was chancellor of Rutgers-Camden and a member of the Philadelphia School Reform Commission. Dr. Pritchett\u2019s son grew up in Society Hill and attended Friends Select.\nDr. Pritchett instilled a love for music in his family, his son said; his two granddaughters sang in the All-City Choir.\n\u201cTeaching is our family business and certainly he and my mom had influence on my desire to be a teacher,\u201d Wendell Pritchett said.\nHe would see the excitement from his father\u2019s former students and how in teaching music, students were able to quickly apply new lessons. This taught him \"how rewarding active learning is,\u201d his son said. Wendell Pritchett now teaches law subjects and tries to incorporate this type of active learning in the classroom by having students think of problems they would have to solve \u201cin the real world,\u201d he said.\nIn retirement, Dr. Pritchett was always curious, his wife said, adding that even when they went on trips, such as their vacation to Spain, he was interested in knowing the history, architecture, music, and language of cities like Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia.\nHe studied languages and thought he had \u201cconquered French,\u201d so moved on to Spanish, Carolyn Pritchett said. He would attend lectures, go to museums, and seek out ways to continue learning.\n\u201cI\u2019m pursuing my studies,\u201d he would say when he was studying something outside of music but needed time for it, she recalled.\nIn addition to his wife and son, Dr. Pritchett is survived by his daughter, Paula Pritchett; a sister and three grandchildren.\nA memorial service will be at 3 p.m. Sunday, May 5, at the Mary Louise Curtis branch of Settlement Music School, 416 Queen St., Philadelphia. Dr. Pritchett\u2019s son said. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to Settlement Music School or the Fund for the School District of Philadelphia.",

(AP) \u2014 At 6-foot-1 and 160 pounds, Jim Pfeiffer is used to being called skinny.\nBut Pfeiffer&apos;s beanpole status came in handy Monday, when the 25-year-old firefighter slipped into a narrow crevasse to rescue a toddler trapped 9 feet underground.\nThe 16-month-old Metuchen boy, John Michael Butterfield, had been running at the Tamaques Park playground with another child under his mother&apos;s watch when he darted off toward an adjacent tennis court. He slipped into one of six holes dug by a contractor earlier that day to support new floodlights.\nA concrete column took up most of the space in the 3-foot-wide hole, but Butterfield fell into a 10-inch gap. His face was pressed against the dirt wall when firefighters arrived, and before long his cries ominously ceased.\nPfeiffer stripped down to a T-shirt and trousers. His colleagues fastened ropes around his waist and ankles, and lowered him headfirst into the gap. Pfeiffer soon became wedged himself, but the boy remained out of reach.\n\"I took one deep breath and tried to make myself as small as I could,\" Pfeiffer told The Star-Ledger of Newark. \"I guess he could sense I was there, because he started crying. That was the best sound in the world.\"\nThe firefighter managed to grip the child&apos;s shirt, and then slip his fingertips under the boy&apos;s armpits.

He spent 43 days in jail in that case.\n\"You have to wonder if he&apos;s done this before and got away with it because of his size,\" Police Capt.

Some say they also hope the move will help cut down on alcohol-related violence and accidents.\n\"The majority of students are very angry because they don&apos;t get why we&apos;re doing this,\" said Chris Johnson, manager of Muncie Liquor.\nAll six of the chain&apos;s stores have been no-keg zones since Saturday.

Suspecting a problem, workers started their own investigation.\n\"Employees did put a video camera in, and that&apos;s how they were able to put a stop to what he was doing,\" Akron Prosecutor Douglas Powley said.\nPowley said Shaheen was unhappy at work but the prosecutor declined to get into any further details.\nNone of Shaheen&apos;s co-workers was physically harmed.\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) \u2014 Peter Symons noticed something odd about a postcard he received in the mail from Florida.\n\"When I looked at it, I saw it had 4 cents in stamps and I said, &apos;Well, that&apos;s sort of strange,&apos;\" he said.\nThen he noticed the postmark: Nov. 7, 1955.\nThe card, which he received Thursday, showed an aerial view of the Fontainebleau Hotel (search) in Miami Beach, Fla.

        "It\u2019s hard to argue that more price transparency in healthcare isn\u2019t needed \u2013 especially as employers increasingly shift to high-deductible plans and Health Savings Accounts that demand more responsibility from their employees.\nBut a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research suggests that price transparency alone could lead consumers to risky conclusions about their need for certain medications and procedures. As part of the study, the researchers, Janet Schwartz of Tulane University\u2019s A.B. Freeman School of Business and Adriana Samper of Arizona State University, gave two groups of people two different flu shot prices, $25 and $125.\nThey found that consumers associated lower medication prices with a greater communal need and, therefore, a greater sense of personal risk and they associated higher prices with less need and less risk. The potential implication: consumers may forgo more expensive medication and procedures on the false belief that they\u2019re less important.\nAs consumer advocates, policy experts and a growing group of startups try to open up the black box of health care costs, it\u2019s an interesting study to keep in mind. And the authors argue that more education about risk and need should accompany price transparency efforts.\nComparison shopping in health care is still in its earliest days, but sites like Castlight Health, ClearCost Health, Clear Health Costs, HealthInReach and PokitDok are trying to give consumers more clarity into health care pricing. Getting the data straight from the providers is tricky (although PokitDok and HealthInReach attempt to do this) but using claims data, many of these sites try to provide consumers with the spectrum of price options for a given procedure or visit.\nAnd some already try to give consumers more context \u2013 such as physician ratings, outcome data when available and patient reviews. That information may not necessarily give patients more insight into their risk around a particular kind of medication or procedure, but it\u2019s a start.\nUntil all purchasers of health services pay the same price for the same service, all the data in the world will remain useless. My health insurance company typically pays 40% of the stated price on the billing from the care provider. Individuals will never get that favored pricing, so they will never have a sound basis for decision making, or indeed, the ability to make sound decisions at all. If you only have $25, it doesn\u2019t matter how safe you want to be. If you can not afford $125 for a vaccine, you will not pay it.\nEverybody needs health care. Nobody needs health insurance. We need a system that provides care for everyone, manages costs equitably and doesn\u2019t see anyones illness as a profit center.\nGood article on the future of health care consumerism! 2 points of clarification. Castlight Health works with employers. It is the most robust transparency platform mentioned, but unless your employer has a contract with them, you can\u2019t use their service. Okcopay is probably the largest provider of health pricing yet they are not mentioned here.\nInteresting findings \u2013 price perception now has another element which is \u201crisk\u201d as you say \u2013 this is similar to price perception where low prices are sometimes associated with low quality. Transparency is a good thing, but for the most part, healthcare still hasn\u2019t really moved to consumerism due to third-party payer\u2019s paying a major percentage of all health bills which leads to the moral hazard of \u201cpatients\u201d relying on other people\u2019s money so driving up cost. It is getting better, but still a long, long way to go.\nThis is a hot-button issue and is piece of the healthcare customer service situation that covers pricing transparency, consumer education and even simple things like presenting a patient with clearly delineated choices based on cost and risk.\nThis broad issue of customer service is a very hot topic on discussion forums with passion on both sides of the issue. I, for one, am very glad we\u2019re having this national (and international) debate.",
        "While most of the world is busy embracing new businesses and startups, we often leave the artsy and creative stories out for the fag end. Cooking is one such promising art and a career that many in our country aspire to. The cooking show Rupchanda-The Daily Star Super Chef is a quintessential platform that has found a tremendous number of raw talents over the years. We caught up with some ex-participants and an organiser to find out how this show has paved the way for living the culinary dream.\n\u201cSuper Chef started off with the motive to provide a recognisable platform to the home-grown, amateur cooks out there,\u201d says Faisal Mahmud, Marketing Manager of Bangladesh Edible Oil Ltd. and the brains behind Super Chef. Each season consists of 30 episodes full of mind-boggling culinary challenges. Even though the show struggles to garner viewership, it has still proved to be the giant leap toward materialising the participants' dream of becoming a chef. \u201cSome ex-contestants are now chefs by profession, some have opened up hotels and restaurants, some have acted in TVCs as Super Chef or are doing their own cooking TV shows, while some have opened up cooking classes at home. So the platform has indeed proved to be no less valuable than a university certificate,\u201d quips Faisal Mahmud.\nNot only did the cooks manage to impress judges and audiences at Super Chef, but post-show job prospects soared like anything. Moreover, Super Chef employs some ex-participants back as tasters and even judges. \u201cEx-winners later become regional round judges and are invited as guest judges in later episodes. Top seven to eight participants are also allowed to take classes at Shopno Super Shop, all expenses borne by us,\u201d adds Faisal.\nAt the end of the day, however, the success and impact of a show as promised can be vouched for by none other than the participants themselves. Nadim Sarker, second runner-up of Super Chef 2015 and now a chef at Platinum Suites says, \u201cMonths after the show ended, I got calls from both Radisson and Platinum Suites and although I got selected by both, I ended up choosing the latter. Since then I have cooked for foreign diplomats, Mashrafe Bin Murtaza and even the entire Bangladeshi cricket team. Every day at the kitchen is a new challenge. And besides being featured in a TVC, I am a regular at cooking shows.\u201d Rafia Ahammed, winner of Super Chef 2016, is also hosting a cooking show, Glitter Rannaghor, on NTV and was a cooking coach in this year's Super Chef.\nRafia, whose specialty is Italian, was also a student of science, but chose cooking due to a knack for the creative. However, she has faced her share of turndowns. \u201cI've spoken at so many hotels and unfortunately most believe that a woman can't work long hours a day as a chef. It's disappointing.\u201d She didn't stop there though. Rafia is now doing short courses on cooking and applying abroad for a long course to establish her career as a chef. Both chefs suggest that to stay in flow with all latest food trends in our country, a chef must keep learning international, up-to-date techniques.\nBut a lot of families do not see a chef's title as a reputed one in our country, and both ex-contestants vented about this. \u201cIt's frustrating when you are labelled a baburchi and looked down upon. A chef is no less than a doctor or an engineer and so this profession must not be degraded,\u201d says Rafia. What the culinary career offers, according to them, is greater value and respect over time because it is a globally demanded profession with a vast scope. \u201cAn added satisfaction is when you can bring a smile to someone's face with your cooking,\u201d remarks Nadim.\n\u201cIf you choose to be a chef, do so because you love cooking, not because it pays well to be a chef nowadays. Once you master the art, money and respect will follow in ample amounts,\u201d concluded Nadim. Cooking is thus an art that must be followed as a profession only if one is completely and utterly passionate about it. Half-hearted dedication will take you nowhere.\nThe writer is a junior at the Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka.",

A second case was opened in Virginia earlier this year on related charges that ended with a jury finding Manafort guilty on eight counts out of an 18-count indictment, facing a maximum of 80 years behind the bars, though under sentencing guidelines the term is likely to be closer to seven years. He has not been sentenced in that case.\nHe joined the president's campaign in March 2016 and became campaign chairman in May, and left the campaign in August days after the New York Times and the Associated Press ran reports that he had been tied to alleged undisclosed foreign lobbying practices in Ukraine.\nA spokesperson for Manafort and a representative for the special counsel\u2019s office both declined to comment.\nABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.",

Mya said the parade will be the first time she can remember participating in the event.\n\"I'm glad I get the chance to be in the parade and experience the Black Family Reunion,\" she said.\nFor Jason and Tiffany, the honor allows them to share an insight with other parents they had after returning home from Mya's college tour.\n\"When we got home with all the email and texting and work and Instagram, we realized that 'Wow, the kids are about to leave soon, so what are we going to do?'\" Jason Dunn said. \"So our piece was, 'Let's put down our phone and try to connect, whether they like it or not.' Our jobs as parents isn't for them to always like us.\"\nTiffany Dunn created the \"90 Minute Challenge\" as a way to get her family to put away electronics, stop thinking about work or school and spend quality time together each day. She admitted the challenge can be difficult some days between her husband's schedule and her own as a certified registered nurse anesthetist at Seven Hills Anesthesia.\n\"I think it's more about being aware of the importance of time,\" she said. \"Time is so precious. What we wanted to do was to be more present. It's not so much the time, but being present.\"\nAs someone with a very public-facing job that involves long hours promoting Cincinnati nationally as a diverse city to visit, Jason Dunn said he is grateful his entire family is being honored for all they do.\n\"I think for me it is people get to see where my inspiration comes from,\" he said. \"And a lot of times I might get credit because my job is very public, but people don't really realize that my family is really the motivation. My wife really holds down the fort. And I think the tremendous sacrifice that we go through on a day-to-day basis and to find ways to still be involved is no small feat. To see my wife and my daughter and my son makes us real for other people. And it gives them (his family) the opportunity to see what the community sees in us. Sometimes when you work in a vineyard it's hard to appreciate the sunlight. So, when you get honored and you stop and say, 'Wow, we did all this', and look back it gives you a sense of appreciation.\"\nJason Dunn began working for the CVB in 2004. Years earlier, the Columbus native moved to Cincinnati to attend the University of Cincinnati. His wife grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, and attended UC at the same time as her future husband. The couple met while working as resident assistants in a dorm.\n\"I was playing some Frankie Beverly and cooking in the dorm,\" Jason Dunn said. \"She (Tiffany) was walking past. She came in and told me to turn my music down. She ended up sitting down and talking and she fell in love with me.\"\n\"That's not how I remember the story, but I'll let him have this, his perception of it,\" Tiffany Dunn said with a smile.\nThe couple married in December 2006. Both said they've passed on multiple opportunities to move to other cities over the years.\n\"Actually, I think Cincinnati is more my home because I've been here for about 20 years,\" Tiffany Dunn said. \"It was nice for me, because Youngstown is relatively small. Cincinnati has more of a family feel to it.\"\n\"We are a regular family who has had its ups and downs and still have room to grow as a young married couple,\" Jason Dunn added. \"But you know, life has a way of putting you on a path to make you stronger.

        "UNITED NATIONS, Jul 19 2018 (IPS) - It is with great pleasure and pride that I interact with you this afternoon as India\u2019s Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, to share some thoughts on India\u2019s extremely ambitious, and arguably the world\u2019s largest planned urbanization programme under the leadership of our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.\nIn 1947, when we became an independent country, 17% of our population lived in urban areas. This 17% was on a population base of 350 million or so. At present, over 30% of our population, on a base of 1.2 billion, lives in urban centres.\nBy 2030, when we complete work of the 2030 Development Agenda, nearly 600 million Indians, or 40% of our population, will reside in urban spaces. To lay further emphasis on India\u2019s urban prospects \u2013 from now till 2030, India has to build 700 to 900 million square meters of urban space every year.\nIn other words, India will have to build a new Chicago every year from now till 2030 to meet its urban demand. More importantly, the new urban infrastructure India builds for 2030, 70% of which still needs to be constructed, will have to be green and resilient.\nIndia has been in the vanguard of the sustainable development agenda even prior to 2015. By promoting cooperative federalism, ensuring integrated planning through convergence, and focusing on an outcome-based approach compared to a project-based approach, we have embarked upon the most ambitious and comprehensive programme of planned urbanisation ever undertaken in the world.\nWith these principles as the backbone, India is implementing some of the world\u2019s largest and most ambitious national schemes for social inclusion, economic growth, and environmental sustainability, through silo-breaking approaches.\nIn the words of Prime Minister Modi at the UN summit for post-2015 development agenda, \u201cJust as our vision behind Agenda 2030 is lofty, our goals are comprehensive. It gives priority to the problems that have endured through the past decades. And, it reflects our evolving understanding of the social, economic and environmental linkages that define our lives\u201d.\nIndia has consistently achieved a growth rate of over 7% year on year through bold economic reforms, and has strong prospects for an even higher growth rate in the near future. Given our size and scale, India is fast becoming a pillar of global growth and stability.\nAs President of the Governing Council of UN-Habitat, it gives me great pleasure to note international efforts towards inclusive, resilient, and sustainable human settlements and SDG 11 have been greatly strengthened in the last few years by the New Urban Agenda signed at Habitat III, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Quito Declaration on Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements.\nToday, more than 90% of the global urban growth is occurring in the developing world. India, China, and Nigeria together will account for 35 % of the growth in the world\u2019s urban population between 2018 and 2050. It would not be an overstatement to say that India\u2019s urban agenda will constitute one of the defining projects of the 21st century.\nUrban areas in India face multi-pronged challenges. We remain confronted by a complex ecosystem of urban challenges through and in ensuring housing for all, technology based solutions to enhance service delivery, better mobility and greener transport, smart governance, and in doing more with less.\nMahatma Gandhi had famously said, \u201cFreedom from insanitary practices is even more important than political freedom\u201d.\nAs a tribute to the father of the nation, India launched the largest sanitation and hygiene program in the world \u2013 the Swachh Bharat Mission, with the objective of make India open defecation free and achieve scientific waste management by October 2nd 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma, well ahead of the deadline for SDG 6.\nThe Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and the National Rural Drinking Water Program (NRDWP) seek to provide urban and rural areas with universal drinking water supply and sewage treatment respectively. Both these missions have been making steady progress and are on track to achieve their goals.\nThe Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or the Prime Minister\u2019s scheme on Affordable Housing for All is the world\u2019s largest housing programme for the poor. The government aims to build 11 million affordable homes for urban Indians by the year 2022.\nWe have already sanctioned over 5 million and are confident of meeting the targets by middle of 2019. Giving a fillip to gender empowerment, the title of each home under the Mission is under the lady of the house, or co-jointly.\nThe mission also encompasses a Technology Sub-Mission to facilitate adoption of green, disaster resistant building materials and construction techniques for ensuring faster and cost- effective construction.\nThis not only addresses SDG 11 directly but also aims to effectuate, SDG 1 by ending spatial poverty of homeless people; SDG 3 by giving access to all-weather protected living environment; SDG 7 through increased usage of sustainable, affordable construction practices; and SDG 10 by reducing inequalities of access to basic minimum standard of living.\nIndia is in the process of creating 100 Smart Cities to strengthen urban infrastructure by applying smart solutions and giving a decent quality of life to citizens. Improving the urban governance reforms through creation of Integrated Command and Control Centre has made city management efficient and effective resulting in savings of city revenues.\nThis has made a significant impact on India\u2019s promise to create inclusive and sustainable cities under the SDG 11 by building institutional capabilities through efficient administrative processes and strengthening grassroots democracy.\nSmart Cities Mission also focuses on SDG 12 by reducing the pressure on resources through promotion of sustainable consumption and production pattern which again is promoted by sustainable practices being adopted by cities in reducing the carbon footprint, leveraging vertical expansion and reducing the overall burden on infrastructural resources by switching to cleaner substitutes.\nIndia has ensured that all its international commitments are mirrored in the national development goals. With India striving to meet its national socio-economic development targets, achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 169 targets linked to them will be a major success story of the millennium affecting more than a billion persons all at once.\nIndia\u2019s national development goals and its \u201cSab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas\u201d or \u201cdevelopment with all, and for all,\u201d policy initiatives for inclusive development converge well with the SDGs, and India will play a leading role in determining the success of the SDGs, globally.\nAs Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted, \u201cThe sustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be of great consequence to the world and our beautiful planet.\u201d India stands truly committed to achieving an equitable and sustainable future for all its citizens, and in working with the global community to achieve the SDGs together.",
        "Kalieaswari Srinivasan and Herv\u00e9 Goffings in \"The Prisoner.\"\nIn \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d a rare theater experience created by Peter Brook and Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Estienne, shackles, walls and bars do not a prison make. One\u2019s own conscience incarcerates the heart and soul. Salvation lies within.\nSounds simple, doesn\u2019t it? And \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d currently enjoying its American premiere at Yale Repertory Theatre through Nov. 17, thrives on its simplicity in physical production design, words and performance. This 70-minute allegory fairly ripples with sprawling wisdom and compassion.\nTheatergoers familiar with Brook, universally esteemed as one of the most important and uniquely imaginative directors over the past 60 years, recognize his spare style, which he describes at length in his 1968 book \u201cThe Empty Space.\u201d Indeed, \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d has an ancient, tribal feel to its storytelling, but not because it\u2019s set in a primitive Afghanistan village on the outskirts of a desert. Rather, it\u2019s due to the way that Brook and Estienne (both credited with text and direction) use but a handful of actors and a virtually bare stage to spark our imagination.\nOne actor directly addresses the audience as our ancestors did, sitting around the proverbial fire. The five actors place David Violi\u2019s apparently random fallen branches and sticks in various positions to define specific settings on The Rep stage. This unfettered approach clears the open mind and pricks one\u2019s imagination so that, despite the play\u2019s exotic unities of time, place and action (or because of it), \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d universally speaks to theatergoers of all stripes about punishment, forgiveness and redemption.\nVioli\u2019s set greets the incoming audience with its open, bare walls stage dressed with stray components of a shattered tree. A narrator (Hayley Carmichael, one of three actors playing multiple roles) sets the scene: a small village where a young man, Mavuso (a riveting Hiran Abeysekera), has committed the \u201cunspeakable crime\u201d of patricide. Mavuso, we learn in short order from his uncle Ezekiel (an equally compelling Herv\u00e9 Goffings) is an otherwise good and honorable person, but he bashed his father\u2019s head with a rock after discovering him in bed with his own daughter \u2014 Mavuso\u2019s sister (a heart-breaking Kalieaswari Srinivasan).\nEzekiel metes out Mavuso\u2019s initial punishment as per the customs of the village before surrendering him to the local authorities. Mavuso is sentenced to 20 years in prison, which Ezekiel convinces the judge to commute. Instead of staring at four prison walls from a cell, Mavuso must look at the prison from just outside of its walls, eating whatever flies or scurries by for sustenance. He will remain outside looking in until he believes to his own satisfaction that he has served his penance.\nThough Mavuso interacts with a few characters, he\u2019s left alone most of the time with his conscience. With nothing but time to reflect, Mavuso, \u201cbeggar in infinity,\u201d mourns the loss of his father and Nadia, as well as his soul. His better angels, who prove more relentless than Hugo\u2019s Javert, trap him. One of these encounters tests his ability to forgive himself, Mavuso\u2019s farthest reach.\nA story with minimal kinetic physical action, \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d engages its audience with subtle gestures and fine, nuanced details. In a sense, \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d seems like fertile material for cinema, but the actors communicate ably with understatement.\nIs \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d comparable to some of Brook\u2019s iconic productions, ranging from \u201cMarat/Sade\u201d and \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d? As Brook himself might answer that question, it\u2019s futile at best and foolish at least to field such questions. Sure, there are many signature Brookian flourishes (anti-flourish, more aptly), but \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d is its own deal. One will likely find the wisdom in its quiet, and empathy in its pace.\nE. Kyle Minor is the Register theater reviewer.",
        "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is opposed to even limited U.S. military intervention in Syria because it believes rebels fighting the Assad regime wouldn't support American interests if they were to seize power right now, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote to a congressman in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.\nEffectively ruling out U.S. cruise missile attacks and other options that wouldn't require U.S. troops on the ground, Dempsey said the military is clearly capable of taking out Syrian President Bashar Assad's air force and shifting the balance of the Arab country's 2 1/2-year war back toward the armed opposition. But he said such an approach would plunge the United States deep into another war in the Arab world and offer no strategy for peace in a nation plagued by ethnic rivalries.\n\"Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,\" Dempsey said in the letter Aug. 19 to Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. \"It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.\"\nDempsey's pessimistic assessment will hardly please members of the fractured Syrian opposition leadership and some members of the administration who have championed greater support to help the rebellion end Assad's four-decade family dynasty. Despite almost incessant bickering and internal disputes, some opposition groups have worked with the United States and other European and Arab supporters to try to form a cohesive, inclusive movement dedicated to a democratic and multiethnic state.\nBut those fighting the Assad government range wildly in political and ethnic beliefs and not all are interested in Western support.\nAs the conflict has gone on, killing more than 100,000 people and ripping apart the delicate sectarian fabric of Syrian society, al-Qaida-linked rebels and other extremist groups have been responsible for some of the same types of massacres and ethnic attacks that the Assad regime has committed. On Tuesday, Kurdish militias battled against al-Qaida-linked fighters in the northeast in fighting that has fueled a mass exodus of refugees into Iraq and risks exploding into a full-blown side conflict.\nDempsey said Syria's war was \"tragic and complex.\"\n\"It is a deeply rooted, long-term conflict among multiple factions, and violent struggles for power will continue after Assad's rule ends,\" he wrote. \"We should evaluate the effectiveness of limited military options in this context.\"\nOn Wednesday, two Syrian pro-opposition groups claimed that government forces carried out a \"poisonous gas\" attack near the capital, Damascus, leaving dozens of people dead. There was no government comment on the claims and the reports could not be independently confirmed.\nDespite calling for Assad to leave power in 2011, President Barack Obama has steadfastly refused to allow the U.S. to be drawn directly into the conflict. Officials have said for the past couple of months, however, that the U.S. is prepared to provide lethal aid to vetted, moderate units among the opposition ranks. It's unclear what, if any, weapons have been delivered so far.\nDempsey's letter to Engel was another follow-up to a sharp examination he faced in July from the Senate Armed Services Committee ahead of a reconfirmation vote. Unable to answer questions by Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, Dempsey sent a letter afterward saying the establishment of a no-fly zone to protect the Syrian rebels would require hundreds of U.S. aircraft at a cost as much as $1 billion a month and with no assurance that it would change the war's momentum.\nHe also discouraged options such as training vetted rebel groups, limited strikes on Syria's air defenses and creating a buffer zone for the opposition, stressing the need to avoid an outcome similar to Iraq or Afghanistan by preserving a functioning state for any future power transfer. And he cited risks such as lost U.S. aircraft.\nEngel, another advocate of more forceful U.S. action, joined the debate by proposing the use of cruise missiles and other weapons against Syrian government-controlled air bases in an Aug. 5 letter to Dempsey. The congressman said such strikes would ground Assad's air force and reduce the flow of weapons to his government from Iran and Russia, while costing less to U.S. taxpayers and requiring no American troops on the ground in Syria or in its airspace.\nDempsey said this approach wouldn't tip the balance against Assad and wouldn't solve the deeper problems plaguing Syria.\n\"We can destroy the Syrian air force,\" he said. \"The loss of Assad's air force would negate his ability to attack opposition forces from the air, but it would also escalate and potentially further commit the United States to the conflict. Stated another way, it would not be militarily decisive, but it would commit us decisively to the conflict.\"\n\"The use of U.S. military force can change the military balance,\" Dempsey added. \"But it cannot resolve the underlying and historic ethnic, religious and tribal issues that are fueling this conflict.\"\nInstead, he spoke in favor of an expansion of the Obama administration's current policy.\nThe U.S. can provide far greater humanitarian assistance and, if asked, do more to bolster a moderate opposition in Syria. Such an approach \"represents the best framework for an effective U.S. strategy toward Syria,\" Dempsey said.",
        "On Monday, the company is announcing a global research and development consortium that will tap brainpower from Samsung, China Mobile, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other participants. The goal of the consortium, called Green Touch, will be to demonstrate dramatically more efficient wired and wireless network gear within five years.\nRecognizing that networks, like data centers, don't run on good intentions alone, the head of research at Alcatel's storied Bell Labs wants telecom's top scientists to start with a blank slate and reinvent telecommunications infrastructure to use less power. If Green Touch hits its targets, the new equipment will run for three years on the power that current systems use up in just one day, said Gee Rittenhouse, vice president of research at Bell Labs and the head of Green Touch.\n\"What we're trying to do is really think about it afresh,\" said Rittenhouse, a longtime researcher at the lab. Whereas vendors today design products for high performance while also considering power requirements, Green Touch is going to design them for efficiency first while also keeping performance in mind.\n\"Normally, the research done today is about taking today's network and refining it ... instead of erasing the board, starting from an open mind, and building up from there,\" Rittenhouse said. The power-saving technology available today, even if it were applied throughout all networks, would only keep power consumption flat over the coming years, he said.\n\"We've never said, 'Stop. If we were to design a network that was optimized for energy, what would it look like?'\"\nThe minimum power consumption for today's Internet and carrier networks around the world would be zero, which would be achieved by turning them all off, Rittenhouse said. Assuming no one wants to do that, the theoretical minimum power for actually running those networks would be lower than today's energy use by a factor of 10,000, he said.\nGreen Touch intends to achieve just one-tenth of that, but even for this effort the group wants to bring in experts from throughout the industry. In addition to Samsung, China Mobile and MIT, the consortium will include Freescale Semiconductor, SwissCom, Telefonica, Stanford University, the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control, and other entities. But many other key players, such as Ericsson, Cisco and any major U.S. carrier, were not listed as members.\nThe most efficient parts of the global infrastructure are fiber-optic networks, which transmit streams of data as wavelengths, or colors, of light. They are nearly 100 percent efficient, according to Rittenhouse. But at the ends of those fiber networks are usually older copper wires or wireless systems that don't work as efficiently. The most waste comes from cellular systems, because they have to send a signal out over a wide area just to reach the one subscriber it is meant for, Rittenhouse said.\nThough a clean-slate approach may deliver fresh ideas, it's likely to take a long time for the revolutionary products that come from Green Touch to start saving energy. Between standardization, product development and trials, it typically takes between five and 10 years after the first lab demonstrations for a totally new technology to be deployed, Rittenhouse said.\nThe Green Touch initiative is critical for the long-term future of communications, though it faces some challenges, according to analyst Kneko Burney of Compass Intelligence.\n\"There is no other objective more pressing than to ensure that the demand for energy does not exceed the limitations of our ability to generate it,\" Burney said in an e-mail interview.\n\"There does not seem to be a clear plan for Alcatel in this consortium, and the list of members is still quite modest. But, this is to be expected. It will take time for Alcatel to pull in more members and really make some scientific and technical breakthroughs,\" she said.\n\"The big question is, how long can the scientists in Alcatel do their science thing in this highly competitive market without the wolves of capitalism requiring profit-generating activities from them,\" Burney added.\nFor Rittenhouse and Alcatel, Green Touch is an aspirational as much as a practical effort.\n\"This allows us to set an ambitious goal, a very high bar, with an exciting possibility at the end,\" he said.",
        "GENEVA \u2013 The Head of the UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, Justice Richard Goldstone, today urged the international community to put an end to impunity for violations of international law in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory as he presented the report of the Mission* to the Human Rights Council.\nFollowing its three-month investigation, the four-person Mission concluded that serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel in the context of its military operations in Gaza from December 27, 2008 to January 18, 2009, and that Israel committed actions amounting to war crimes, and possibly crimes against humanity.\nThe Mission also found that Palestinian armed groups had committed war crimes, as well as possibly crimes against humanity.\nAs neither the Government of Israel nor the responsible Palestinian authorities had to date carried out any credible investigations into alleged violations, Justice Goldstone urged the 47 Member States of the Human Rights Council to implement a number of measures, including referral of the Mission\u2019s report to the UN Security Council. The Mission report recommends that the Security Council require Israel and the authorities in Gaza to report to it, within six months, on investigations and prosecutions it should carry out with regard to the violations identified by the Mission.\nThe Mission recommends that the Security Council set up a body of independent experts to report to it on the progress of the Israeli and Palestinian investigations and prosecutions. If the experts\u2019 reports do not indicate within six months that good faith, independent proceedings are taking place, the Security Council should refer the situation in Gaza to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor.\nThe Fact Finding Mission, headed by Justice Richard Goldstone, who is a former judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa and former Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, also comprises Hina Jilani, Advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and a member of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (2004); Professor Christine Chinkin, Professor of International Law at the London School of Economics and Political Science and a member of the high-level fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun (2008); and Colonel Desmond Travers, a former Officer in Ireland\u2019s Defence Forces and a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute for International Criminal Investigations.\nThe Mission found that the repeated acts of firing rockets and mortars into Southern Israel by Palestinian armed groups from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip constituted war crimes that may amount to crimes against humanity.\nIn the lead up to the Israeli military assault on Gaza, the Mission said it found that Israel had imposed a blockade amounting to collective punishment and carried out a systematic policy of progressive isolation and deprivation of the Gaza Strip. During the Israeli military operation, code-named \u201cOperation Cast Lead,\u201d more than 1,400 people were killed, including women and more than 340 children, and houses, factories, wells, schools, hospitals, police stations and other public buildings were destroyed.\nThe report concludes that the Israeli military operation was directed at the people of Gaza as a whole, in furtherance of an overall and continuing policy aimed at punishing the Gaza population, and in a deliberate policy of disproportionate force aimed at the civilian population. The Report states that Israeli acts that deprive Palestinians in the Gaza Strip of their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water, that deny their freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country, that limit their rights to access a court of law and an effective remedy, and could lead a competent court to find that the crime of persecution, a crime against humanity, has been committed.\n\u201cThe Government of Israel has a duty to protect its citizens,\u201d Justice Goldstone told the Human Rights Council, \u201cThat in no way justifies a policy of collective punishment of a people under effective occupation, destroying their means to live a dignified life and the trauma caused by the kind of military intervention the Israeli Government called Operation Cast Lead. This contributes to a situation where young people grow up in a culture of hatred and violence, with little hope for change in the future. Finally, the teaching of hate and dehumanization by each side against the other contributes to the destabilization of the whole region,\u201d he said.\nAs well as calling for justice, the Members of the Mission urged the Human Rights Council to take action that would ensure the protection of victims, prevent further violence and improve the living conditions of the affected people.",
        "Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Senator Corey Booker (D-New Jersey) this morning introduced the Commodity Checkoff Program Improvement Act of 2016 that would require a new level of transparency and oversight for United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) checkoff boards. The bill would prohibit checkoff programs from engaging in anticompetitive activities or disparaging rival products or commodities.\nThe nation\u2019s 22 checkoff boards promote individual agricultural commodities such as lamb, peanuts, avocados, pork, potatoes and cotton, and are probably best known for creating promotional campaigns for beef (It\u2019s What\u2019s for Dinner), eggs (The Incredible Edible Egg) and dairy (Got Milk?). The USDA oversees checkoff programs and collects the mandatory fees from producers.\nEmails obtained through a FOIA request revealed that American Egg Board leaders and top executives in the egg industry had hoped to slow the growth of an egg-free mayonnaise competitor, Just Mayo, by working with a public relations agency and attempting to keep the product off of Whole Foods shelves. Board leaders had also discussed notifying the Food and Drug Administration about what they believed was Just Mayo\u2019s misleading name.\nThe USDA opened an investigation of the American Egg Board, which is ongoing, after the emails were released.\nAnother controversy erupted this May when House Republicans included language in the proposed 2017 House Agricultural Appropriations bill that would exempt checkoff programs from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The language was requested by checkoff programs and other commodity groups.\nThe bill would require checkoff programs to publish their budgets and would mandate the disclosure of all payments to outside contractors, as well as the purpose of those payments. Programs would be prohibited from contracting with organizations that lobby on agricultural policy and checkoff employees would be barred from participating in activities that constitute a conflict of interest. The bill would also require a routine audit of all checkoff programs every 5 years by USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General , which would be shared with Congress.\n\u201cThis bill will limit power these governmental boards have to inhibit food innovators through critical ad campaigns or by bolstering industry incumbents,\u201d Lee said in an email. \"For taxpayers this is a simple question of whether the government they are paying for is being fair and using their tax dollars appropriately.\"\nThe American Egg Board was contacted for comments on the bill but has yet to respond. This post will be updated if they do.",
        "BRAD HORN/Nevada Appeal Ruben Correa, of Carson City, leaps over a car to get to his vehicle near Curry Street in Carson City on Saturday. A state of emergency was declared because of the flooding.\nThe New Year came in with a wave as Carson City and the surrounding communities found themselves battling floods and mudslides brought on by the onslaught of three moisture-packed winter storms.\nCarson City residents awoke Saturday to find the capital city\u2019s main arteries flooded by fast moving rainwater that carried down the mountains trees leveled by last summer\u2019s Waterfall fire.\nCarson City declared a state of emergency at a special meeting of the board of supervisors around 7 a.m. Saturday morning.\nIn Ash and Kings canyons, about 4 to 6 inches of rain were estimated to have fallen and central Carson City reportedly got an estimated 2 to 3 inches, according to Brian Brong with the National Weather Service.\nAt Lake Tahoe, the storms raised the lake level a half foot between Friday and Saturday, according the National Weather Service in Reno.\nA vehicle parked at Gottschalks had water up to its windows and the driver of a white Cadillac underestimated the depth of water on North Curry Street that began pooling behind the Shell Gas station about 7:30 a.m.\nBy 9:15 it was up to 5 feet, said Charles Hooper of Batteries Plus.\nThe abandoned vehicle floated in the water, moving with each wave brought on by passing vehicles.\nThat Curry Street was still open at 10 a.m. with that much water, angered Vital Signs owner Mike McIntosh.\n\u201cThe city needs to just block the damn road! It\u2019s creating damage to my shop when people drive through it,\u201d he said, trying to avoid the wakes that washed up to his building. McIntosh said the water was especially deep because the city neglected to clear a storm drain on Curry Street before the rain started.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201d He shouted at a truck making its way through.\nBy noon the road was blocked by cones.\nSome homes on Murphy Drive were evacuated as a precaution, said Sheriff Ken Furlong.\nRetention ponds in front of Quiznos and Starbucks gave the businesses lake-front property as water crept toward Highway 395.\nThis was the worst flooding the city had seen since the floods of 1997, said Mayor Marv Teixeira, but that flood taught the city invaluable lessons.\nRoads that weren\u2019t closed due to flooding, were bogged down by mud and rock, such as Timberline Drive, just past College Parkway, and Waterford Place and Longview Way.\nHomeowners at a residence at the bottom of Timberline spent their morning digging out their garage.\nJust off Kings Canyon Road, neighbors pitched in to help a homeowner who was out of town.\nWhen Neil Rombardo decided to check on his friend\u2019s Ormsby Boulevard home, he found water filled the laundry room, mud room, game room and garage.\nFortunately, the main areas of the home hadn\u2019t yet been breached, he said.\nRombardo sprang into action, gathering up as many bodies as he could find, including seventh-graders Jonathan and Connor and 8-year-old Riley. By 10 a.m., nine people were in a line, piling sandbags around the home.\nChris Van Dyck, who was offering his help, said this flood was similar to 1997, but for one major point.\n\u201cThey were more prepared this time. The city did a good job,\u201d he said.\nStorm drains couldn\u2019t keep up with the heavy rain, causing flooding in low-lying areas such as U.S. 395 by the Carson Mall.\nIn Douglas County, officials reported small mud or rock slides but no major problems.\nAlso in Douglas County, standing water closed Genoa, Mottsville, Centerville and Muller lanes between U.S. 395 and Foothill Road.\nIn Lyon County, localized flooding and flash flooding was reported in Dayton, Dayton Valley, Mound House, Silver City, Stagecoach and Mark Twain. Standing water of about 4 feet was reported in some areas. Two trailer parks in the Dayton Area were evacuated and residents were offered shelter at Sutro Elementary School in Dayton.

        "Keep it classy. Cheer. Revel in a rival. And Yankees - keep it brief, a simple ceremony of appreciation.\nSure, there will be temptation for fans to boo one of the faces of the Red Sox's championship seasons in 2004, 2007 and 2013. Big Papi has tormented the Yankees over the years, pounding 52 homers against them (51 as a member of the Sox), and taking forever to round the bases after each one.\nYes, there are some who speculate whether Ortiz did PEDs and won't like the idea of Ortiz being honored on the Stadium field because of that. There were examples of that sort of talk on social media Thursday after the Yanks announced the Sept. 29 shindig.\nPlease. Those folks who are upset must have forgotten that Andy Pettitte's No. 46 is forever retired. Didn't Alex Rodriguez get plenty of ovations in the Bronx?\nGive one to Ortiz, too. The ceremony is the perfect time to recognize Ortiz's love for baseball, his flair for the dramatic, his showmanship. And the day he spoke to a wounded populace following the Boston Marathon bombing, reminding them and the terrorists just whose f-ing city Boston is.\nWe know you have reviled the Red Sox since you were born. Pinstriped blood courses through your veins. You worship the Core Four and your fervent wishes every day are a Yankee victory followed by a Sox loss.\nYou can't stand the idea of a party for someone wearing that uniform. We get it.\nThe Red Sox hit two extremes when they honored Rivera and Jeter on Landsdowne Street and, in so doing, failed to hit either over the Green Monster, if you will.\nThey got too cute with the Rivera party, what with all those 2004 comeback references - ha, ha! - and that colored the whole thing, even as they made a nice donation to help him build a school in Panama and gave him some other cool gifts. Jeez, was it a roast or a celebration?\nRivera, consummate gentleman, laughed off the reminders, but they went on too long and felt awkward.\nThe next year, when Jeter was leaving, they lavished too much praise on the Yankee captain. The pre-game ceremony lasted about 30 minutes and Boston sports luminaries as varied as Bobby Orr and Carl Yastrzemski were there.\nThere were gifts, cheers, applause. Fenway's manual scoreboard in the Mawn-stah displayed the message: \"WITH RESPECT 2 DEREK JETER.\"\nIt felt excessive. Maybe they were trying to make up for the Rivera ceremony. Either way, the Yankees should strive for something less complicated when they recognize Ortiz - a few highlights, a New York-centric gift, applause, handshakes with some key Yanks. Forget going for humor or pleasing the fans who are unhappy about the festivities.\nHonor the man and that's it. Ortiz has been recognized every place he's played his final game already.\nHe got a surfboard in San Diego, red wine in Oakland. His two previous organizations got creative. Seattle gave him 34 pounds of salmon, among other gifts, and the Twins gave him peanut butter jars with his face on them, a sly reference to a clubhouse prank where Corey Koskie, Torii Hunter and Eddie Guardado put peanut butter in Ortiz's underwear. Minnesota also made a $10,000 donation to the Kirby Puckett Scholar's Foundation, recognizing Ortiz's relationship with the Twins' great.\n\"I'm appreciative of the fact that the Yankees are doing something for me because of our long-standing rivalry,\" Ortiz said through a club spokesman. \"It means a lot to me.\"\nOrtiz did not make himself available to talk to reporters before Thursday night's game. Maybe he has a sense that some believe it's odd the Yanks are honoring him. Joe Girardi doesn't look at it that way, though.\n\"I think we've been through it enough on the other side that we kind of understand what to expect,\" Girardi said. \"We understand why it takes place. He's been a great player for a long, long time, and he's been really good for the game of baseball.\"\nGirardi added: \"As Reggie (Jackson) said, boos in an opposing ballpark are really cheers. It should be interesting. I was somewhat taken aback by the applause that Derek got here. It was really special.\n\"Even though he's done a lot damage, I hope people show him the respect that he's earned in this game.\"",
        "Johni Esho, also known as J. Esho, is using the 2019 Junos in London as an opportunity to spotlight his work among Canadian musical greats.\nThe Eshos were pretty much a household name in Tel Tamer, Syria.\nWhen Khoshaba and Mona, an Assyrian singer-guitarist duo, weren't dominating gigs in town, they were operating the popular Babylon, the area's only recording studio.\nBusiness was good, but the studio had to close its doors in 2005, when Khoshaba and Mona moved their growing family to Canada for greater opportunities.\nIt didn't take long for Assyrian tunes to ring out once again \u2014 this time in London, Ont.\nTen years later, it was their son Johni Esho, who followed in his mom and dad's musical footsteps by building his own recording studio in the basement of his parents' northeast London home.\nJohni, also known as singer-songwriter and producer J. Esho, wears his musical lineage with pride.\n\"It's in my blood,\" he said.\nWhile it was his musical family that first introduced him to what would become his life's work, it was his hometown's obsession with live tunes that fuelled his passion.\n\"Everybody there was into music,\" he said, noting that despite Tel Tamer's relatively small population of about 10,000, it had an outsized music scene.\n\"That was the only fun for us,\" he said. \"It was family, friends and music, that's how it was.\"\nAs Esho grew, so did his passion. By age of 12, he could already play bass, guitar, piano and drums, he even produced an entire album.\n\"This is easy, I can learn it,\" he always told himself.\nEsho eventually gravitated toward North American artists such as rapper TupacShakur and American-Mexican musician Carlos Santana.\nThrough North American music, Esho started teaching himself English by learning song lyrics.\nSo, when he learned he was moving to Canada, Esho thought, \"oh, man, this is going to be good \u2026 it's going to be a new world.\"\nEsho's family is lucky. They left Syria before the country disintegrated into a brutal and bloody civil war. Because Assyrians still face persecution there, many more families like Esho's have left their war-shattered homeland to start new lives in North America.\nEsho's basement studio is fully equipped with a computer, work station, microphone and sound proof barrier and it has attracted partnerships with Assyrian artists from across the globe, including Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Australia and the U.S.\nEsho's first client was an Assyrian artist from Chicago. After word got out, Esho said \"it just went crazy.\"\n\"I didn't even have time to reply to the requests,\" he said. \"They're like \u2026 this kid is bringing the new style, the new generation.'\"\nEsho said Assyrian music sounds similar to Hebrew music and it has elements of funk, pop and jazz. What makes his signature sound so unique among Assyrian musicians is that he added an electronic, modern touch.\nWith an established reputation for his modern twist to the folk/pop genre, Esho has produced music for the likes of popular Assyrian artists such as singer Linda George and German-Assyrian musician SargonYoukhanna.\n\"Everybody wanted a piece of it,\" he said.\nNow, Esho is trying to focus on his own singing career. Like his producing style, his own songs are different and are influenced by Western culture.\nHe described his style as pop, R&B and electronic dance music (EDM). He said he likes to sing about personal experiences including relationships and break-ups.\n\"I try and keep it real,\" he said.\nHe's using the 2019 Junos, hosted in London, as an opportunity to spotlight his work among Canadian musical greats.\nThough he's not part of the official events, Esho is hosting a listening party on Saturday, to celebrate the release of his song Hopeless Love.\n\"I feel really great. I hope I can see some of those big artists. I learned from most of them.\"",
        "Gov. Matt Bevin is trying everything he can to take away any opportunity for teachers to increase their pay. It\u2019s obvious that he doesn\u2019t have any respect for educators. Dealing with other people\u2019s children is one of the hardest jobs a person can sign up for. Bevin knows that teachers with masters degrees earn way more money than teachers without the degrees. The less educated the teacher, the less they get paid, period.\nBevin should prefer to have as many teachers with advanced degrees as he can find, but he seems to think Kentucky doesn\u2019t need to waste money on highly educated teachers to teach a bunch of low-intelligence children with low-achieving parents. To him, we\u2019re a waste of money.\nSmarter, more educated teachers can help our children reach educational goals. I thought teachers had to periodically go back to school in order to learn new subject matters and teaching techniques. We never stop learning, no matter how old we are. Maybe Bevin would be tickled pink if things reverted back to when men felt a woman\u2019s place was in the home and men made all of the important decisions. An old-school-thinking religious fundamentalist like Bevin has no business being our governor.\nFayette County Superintendent Manny Caulk and the school board are the magicians who distract with one hand while performing the \u201cmagic.\u201d Look! We will try to protect students seven hours a day. Don\u2019t look! We just need $13.5 million and this expense never goes away!\nPlease, spend part of that $30 million \u201crainy day fund\u201d instead of increasing taxes on people who don\u2019t even own an umbrella. Adding staff and issuing student identification badges aren\u2019t one-time costs. Each year they will dip into their piggybank, i.e. taxpayers, to cover that cost.\nEven if people don\u2019t own property, rent will go up. Consumers pay utilities and there is a school tax in each bill. Do you get a yearly 4 or 5 percent raise? I don\u2019t. But this board has no problem wiping out our increases and expecting us to cut our tight budgets, while $30 million just sits there.\nESPN doesn\u2019t air the playing of our national anthem before Monday night football games. A convenient excuse is to have more discussion time. Or, maybe they are trying to save face so viewers won\u2019t have to witness the bad behavior of a few players who kneel in protest and disrespect our nation.\nThese players may often be seen grumbling all the way to the bank to spend huge salaries in dollars that clearly read \u201cIn God we trust.\u201d You hear multiple excuses for kneeling, often based on nonsense or political protest or maybe because the person they voted for did not get elected.\nMany men stood their ground and gave all they had so this nation would endure, only to have others burn our flag and spit on the graves of our honored dead. Players who refuse to stand for the anthem should be paid in Euros, and broadcasting agencies should be ashamed. An old friend of my father told me how some people disrespected him, even spit on him. after coming home from Vietnam. They could act like that, he said, because of all of those veterans who stood for freedom in their place.\nThe morning after major national news broke on the Manafort and Cohen cases, MSNBC showed newspaper front pages in states where President Donald Trump will campaign: North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee and Kentucky.\nRep. Andy Barr and likely Gov. Matt Bevin, Kentucky GOP leaders and NRA officials will stand with Trump who brags about having the \u201cbest\u201d people around him as one after another loyalist is indicted or pleads guilty.\nHow will Kentuckians react with time to understand the implications of Trump\u2019s former campaign manager\u2019s guilty verdict and \u201cfixer\u201d lawyer\u2019s guilty plea in a case making Trump an unindicted co-conspirator about hush money paid before the presidential election to two women who allege affairs with him?\nIf Kentuckians attend a Trump rally, I hope they leave impressionable children home and will protect \u2014 rather than threaten \u2014 a penned-up press (remind anyone of caged children?) And if Trump declares nothing to hide, demand: \u201cWhere are your tax returns?\u201d Bevin?\nWith the recent convictions or guilty pleas from Trump associates, talk has again come around to President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment if the Democrats regain control of the House.\nMuch as I dislike Trump and his minions, impeachment should be avoided. The simplest argument is that if one uses the ultimate tool too often, it soon becomes the preferred tool. Impeachment should not become routine.\nWould it not be better to just hamstring him? Instead of the Republicans, evangelicals, and other lowlifes fighting to kiss his \u2026 feet, let the Democrats reestablish what \u201cchecks and balances\u201d were intended to be.\nOh, sure, send his friends and family who have committed crimes to jail where they belong. But Trump? Let him finally realize the failure he is as a human.\nBesides, President Mike Pence? Really?",
        "Vignettes And Characters Shift In 'Chameleons' In The Book of Chameleons, a gecko narrator weaves fragmentary tales of invented pasts into a story of charming airiness. The prize-winning Portuguese novel is set in post-civil war Angola.\nThe \"beach read\" has never held much appeal for me \u2014 just because it's summer, it's not like my IQ drops low enough to be talked down to by James Patterson. But as the temperature rises, my attention span drops, and suddenly an entire episode of Project Runway is difficult to get through in one sitting.\nFortunately, I came across Angola-born Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa's Independent Foreign Fiction Prize-winning The Book of Chameleons, a perfect read for my heat-addled brain. The story of the albino F\u00e9lix Ventura is broken into a series of fragments, each section lasting only a few pages. In post-civil war Angola, F\u00e9lix has switched from selling books to selling personal histories. His business card reads, \"Give your children a better past.\" He forges family trees and stories of noble ancestry for those whose pasts need hiding or improving.\nThe narrator is Eulalio, a dead man reincarnated as a gecko who lives in F\u00e9lix's apartment and becomes his confidante. \"I think what I do is really an advanced kind of literature,\" Felix tells Eulalio. \"I create plots, I invent characters, but rather than keeping them trapped in a book I give them life, launching them out into reality.\"\nAfter F\u00e9lix invents Jos\u00e9 Buchmann, a war photographer who has recently returned to Angola from exile, Buchmann seems to believe wholly in the lie. He becomes obsessed with tracking down his faux mother and draws F\u00e9lix into his dark pasts, both real and created.\nAt 48, Agualusa has been publishing novels in Portuguese since the late '80s, but The Book of Chameleons is his first work to appear in America. Despite the book's subject matter, it has a charming airiness. Feel free to put it down after every tiny segment. You'll certainly be back to see how it ends.\n\"F\u00e9lix Ventura. Guarantee your children a better past.\" And he laughed. A sad laugh, but not unpleasant. \"That would be you, I presume? A friend of mine gave me your card.\"\nThe foreigner closed the door. He walked around the room, his hands clasped behind his back, pausing for a long moment in front of the beautiful oil portrait of Frederick Douglass. Then he sat down, at last, in one of the armchairs, and with an elegant gesture invited the albino to do the same. It was as though he were the owner of the house. Certain common friends, he said - his voice becoming even gentler - had given him this address.They'd told him of a man who dealt in memories, a man who sold the past, clandestinely, the way other people deal in cocaine. F\u00e9lix looked at him with mistrust. Everything about this strange man annoyed him - his manners that were both gentle and authoritative, his ironic way of speaking, the antiquated moustache. He sat himself down in a grand wickerwork chair, at the opposite end of the room, as though afraid the other man's delicacy might be contagious.\n\"And might I know who you are?\"\n\"But do tell me, my dear man - who are your clients?\"\nF\u00e9lix Ventura gave in. There was a whole class, he explained, a whole new bourgeoisie, who sought him out.They were businessmen, ministers, landowners, diamond smugglers, generals - people, in other words, whose futures are secure. But what these people lack is a good past, a distinguished ancestry, diplomas. In sum, a name that resonates with nobility and culture. He sells them a brand new past. He draws up their family tree. He provides them with photographs of their grandparents and great-grandparents, gentlemen of elegant bearing and old-fashioned ladies.The businessmen, the ministers,would like to have women like that as their aunts, he went on, pointing to the portraits on the walls - old ladies swathed in fabrics, authentic bourgeois bessanganas - they'd like to have a grandfather with the distinguished bearing of a Machado de Assis, of a Cruz e Souza, of an Alexandre Dumas. And he sells them this simple dream.\n\"Perfect, perfect.\"The foreigner smoothed his moustache.\"That's what they told me. I require your services. But I'm afraid it may be rather a lot of work...\"\n\"And might I know your name?\"\n\"I've had many names, but I mean to forget them all. I'd rather you were the one to baptize me.\"\n\"You're right. I'm a photojournalist. I collect images of wars, of hunger and its ghosts, of natural disasters and terrible misfortunes. You can think of me as a witness.\"\n\"No!\" he managed to blurt out. \"I don't do things like that. I invent dreams for people, I'm not a forger...And besides, if you'll pardon my bluntness, wouldn't it be a bit difficult to invent a completely African genealogy for you?\"\n\"Indeed! And why is that?!...\"\n\"Well - sir -...you're white.\"\n\"And what of it? You're whiter than I am...\"\n\"White? Me?!\" The albino choked. He took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his forehead. \"No, no! I'm black. Pure black. I'm a native. Can't you tell that I'm black?...\"\n\"Did you hear that? Who laughed just then?\"\n\"Nobody,\" the albino replied, and pointed at me.\"It was the gecko.\"\nThe man stood up. He came up closer and I could feel his eyes on me. It was as though he were looking directly into my soul - my old soul. He shook his head slowly, in a baffled silence.\n\"Do you know what this is?\"\n\"It's a gecko, yes, but a very rare species. See these stripes? It's a tiger gecko - a shy creature, we still know very little about them.They were first discovered half a dozen years ago in Namibia.We think they can live for twenty years - even longer, perhaps.They have this amazing laugh - doesn't it sound like a human laugh?\"\nF\u00e9lix agreed.Yes, to begin with he'd also been disturbed by it. But then having consulted a few books about reptiles - he had them right there in the house, he had books about everything, thousands of them, inherited from his adopted father, a secondhand book dealer who'd exchanged Luanda for Lisbon a few months after independence - he'd discovered that there were certain species of gecko that produce sounds that are strikingly like laughter. They spent some time discussing me, which I found annoying - talking as if I weren't there! - and yet at the same time it felt as though they were talking not about me but about some alien being, some vague and distant biological anomaly. Men know almost nothing of the little creatures that share their homes. Mice, bats, ants, ticks, fleas, flies, mosquitoes, spiders, worms, silverfish, termites, weevils, snails, beetles. I decided that I might as well simply get on with my life. At that sort of time the albino's bedroom used to fill up with mosquitoes, and I was beginning to feel hungry.The foreigner stood up again, went over to the chair where he'd put the briefcase, opened it, and took out a thick envelope. He handed it to F\u00e9lix, said his good-byes, and went to the door. He opened it himself. He nodded, and was gone.",

        "An ill-kept Christmas tree can kill. Here\u2019s how to prevent a holiday disaster.\nThe fresh, cut Christmas tree stands as a fragrant and comforting symbol of the season, but at the risk of injecting some gloom into the holiday, it\u2019s worth pointing out that an ill-kept tree can kill you.\nTree fires are relatively rare, but when they occur, the blaze is so rapid and intense that it can soon turn deadly.\nBetween 2010 and 2012, 10 people died in 200 Christmas tree fires. By contrast, 80 people were killed in a total of 6,500 fires started by candles in the same period, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nA recent demonstration by the commission, conducted at its lab in Rockville, drives home the point. The video shows the ignition of a dried-out tree: In less than 30 seconds, the tree morphs into a floor-to-ceiling Roman candle that consumes its staged room.\nAnother tragic reminder is the fire at the Annapolis mansion of Donald and Sandra Pyle, whose 15-foot Fraser fir was determined to have been the source of an inferno Jan. 19 in which the Pyles and their four grandchildren died. Investigators concluded that the tree probably had been watered only once a week, was dry and dropping needles. The fire probably started from an electrical outlet on the floor beneath the tree, according to a report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Anne Arundel County Fire Department. The tree had as many as 15 strands of lights, which had been left on day and night for six weeks.\nHere are some answers to basic questions about caring for your tree, and yourself.\nWhat sort of stand should I use?\nFind a stand that anchors the tree securely and, for a standard cut tree, holds at least a gallon of water. Do not whittle away or shave the base of the tree to make it fit: This will compromise its ability to take up water. A clean, square cut is what you need, and if the trunk is too fat for the stand, get another stand.\nWhen you buy the tree, the bottom inch or so of trunk should be cut afresh. Drilling a hole in the base of the trunk is a waste of time; the sapwood is toward the outside of the trunk.\nIf you can\u2019t install and decorate a tree right away, you should store it in a cool, sheltered area in a bucket of water.\nHow safe are the electric lights on a tree?\nYou should use strands that are designed for indoor use and bear the label of a testing laboratory. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s limits on the number of strands that can be strung together or plugged into one outlet. Before stringing them, check your old lights carefully for frayed or broken wires or loose bulb holders, all of which can cause fires. Damaged strands should be thrown out.\nHow do trees catch fire?\nThey can be ignited from several sources, including open flames such as a candle, from sparks from a nearby fireplace or wood stove, or an electrical short. In the Annapolis fire, investigators think an electrical floor outlet probably overheated and ignited the tree skirt. Dry trees are much more hazardous than hydrated ones.\nWhere should I place my tree?\nThe better question might be, \u201cWhere should I not place it?\u201d Apart from keeping it away from obvious sources of flames, the tree should be located away from heat sources that will dry it out. These include fireplaces, heat registers, radiators, baseboard heaters or direct sunlight. Lowering the room temperature also will help.\nHow often should I water?\nEvery day. When a cut tree is first placed indoors, the ambient temperature will cause rapid uptake of water. The tree should be checked twice a day for the first few days. After its initial hydration, my seven-foot Fraser fir drinks a quart of water a day.\nDo I need to use additives such as aspirin, soft drinks or floral preservatives?\nNo. Plain, cold tap water is all you need. Additives may impede transpiration.\nDo I need to spray the foliage with waxy anti-desiccants or other products?\nNo. Just keep the tree watered.\nMy tree ran dry. What should I do?\nIf it was only for a few hours, it should be okay once it is watered again. Check it often for drying.\nHow can I tell if my tree is getting dry?\nNeedle drop is a good indication. Also the branches should remain pliable and the needles intact when you run your hand along the branch. If you detect excessive needle loss, fading of color and brittle branches, the tree should be removed pronto.\nHow long can I keep the tree?\nThe Epiphany (Jan. 6) traditionally marks the end of Christmastide, but New Year\u2019s Day seems the optimal moment. Even trees that receive diligent care eventually will stop taking water and dry out.\nIn an attempt to study the flammability of a 15-foot Fraser fir such as the Pyles\u2019, investigators obtained three similarly sized Fraser firs and subjected them to the same environmental conditions: They stored them for 23 days after cutting and then placed them in display stands for 42 days. Two were watered weekly and the third daily. Before a controlled burning, the water content in the first tree was measured at 32 percent. In the second, it was just 15 percent. The third tree had 73 percent moisture content \u2014 nine weeks after cutting.\nExposed to a small flame, the driest tree took five seconds to catch fire and reached peak burn in 35 seconds. The tree watered daily took seven minutes to ignite, released far less heat and parts of it remained unburned.\nI have a tabletop tree and am leaving to see relatives right after Christmas. Will the tree be all right for a few days unwatered?\nTabletop trees require less water but the same principles of care apply. They should be checked and watered daily. If the tree stand is likely to run dry before you return, you should take it down and dispose of it properly.\nHow should I dispose of my tree?\nMost local jurisdictions provide curbside pickup. Don\u2019t leave the old tree in or near your home or in outbuildings. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of fuel,\u201d said Lorraine Carli of the National Fire Protection Association.\nAn amaryllis is the gardening gift of the holidays. Here\u2019s how to keep it alive.",
        "Hollywood lost one of its most iconic talents on Monday when the legendary Penny Marshall died at her home in the Hollywood Hills, leaving behind a legacy of laughs, emotions and genuine warmth.\nPenny came from a family of show business professionals, including her father, Tony Marshall, a director and producer, as well as her older brother, Garry Marshall, who had found success early in life as a comedy writer, and her sister, Ronny Hallin, who worked as a producer and casting director.\nMarshall's career began in front of the camera, as she found fame playing Laverne DeFazio on the Happy Days spin-off Laverne & Shirley, for which she received three Golden Globe nominations.\nHowever, in the early '80s, Marshall got the opportunity to step behind the camera and ended up directing several episodes of her hit sitcom. After working as a director on several TV projects, she made the transition into film with her 1986 comedy Jumpin' Jack Flash, starring Whoopi Goldberg.\nET spoke with Marshall ahead of the film's release, where she opened up about the move from actress to filmmaker.\n\"I'd been approached to direct for many years now,\" Marshall shared. \"I didn't say, 'Choose me to direct.' They seemed to feel I could.\"\n\"I of course first took it as an insult that they didn't want me to act anymore, but that's just me,\" she added with a laugh.\nMarshall later admitted to ET at a special screening of the action comedy that she was \"nervous about an industry screening\" but added earnestly, \"I hope it goes well.\"\nThings certainly went well for Marshall's career after her directorial debut. Two years later, she was tapped to direct Tom Hanks in the 1988 comedy classic Big, which went on to earn two Academy Award nominations -- both for Hanks' performance and for Best Original Screenplay -- and universal critical acclaim.\n\"Some of it's Tom, some of it's me, some of it's written, some of it happened by magic,\" Marshall told ET in 1988, referring to the film's wild popularity. \"I think it's a collaborative effort, even though they say the director is in charge.\"\nWith Big, Marshall became the first female director to helm a film grossing over $100 million, and the pair re-teamed several years later for the 1992 baseball classic A League of Their Own, another commercial and critical success.\nMarshall continued directing and acting throughout her life, forging lasting friendships and lifelong bonds with the stars she appeared with on screen and those she directed.\nIn the wake of her death, due to complications from diabetes, there was a massive outpouring of tributes, memorials, condolences and memories shared by some of the biggest names in Hollywood whose lives were impacted by Marshall's kindness and friendship.

        "Six government departments spent a total of \u00a310.5 million on advertising in February \u2013 up from \u00a34.4 million in September 2014, Labour has claimed.\nThe government stepped up spending on adverts to promote its policies in the months before the election, new figures show.\nA screengrab of a TV advert for the Help to Buy scheme in January.\nLabour uncovered how much six government departments spent on advertising between September 2014 and March 2015.\nThe party found that monthly spending crept up ahead of next month's election \u2013 indicating, they claimed, what \"looks like an abuse of official resources\".\nStrict rules are in place to prevent the government from spending taxpayers' money on overtly political campaigns.\nSpending soared from \u00a34.4 million in September 2014 to \u00a310.5 million in February 2015. The figure for March 2015 is \u00a39.4 million, but this is only an estimate.\nThis is the total spending on \"advertising and communications\" by the six departments.\nThe figures were released in parliamentary answers from each department.\nIt means they spent almost \u00a325 million of public money in the first three months of 2015 \u2013 up from \u00a315 million in the previous quarter.\nThe departments of business, education, justice, culture, environment, and energy were the only ones to provide comparable data for recent months.\nThe adverts were to promote policies such as the Help to Buy scheme, which aims to help young people get on the housing ladder. That ad campaign, which cost \u00a31.8 million, was approved at the end of last year.\nSome \u00a33.3 million worth of advertising for \"Pension Wise\" \u2013 a free guidance scheme for people who are about to retire \u2013 was also approved in the final quarter of last year.\nAnd an advertising campaign for the married couples' tax allowance cost just under \u00a31 million, according to stats obtained by Labour.\nShadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said: \"The Tories are using public funds to bankroll their campaign.\n\"They've been visiting key seats courtesy of the taxpayer and now official advertising campaigns are promoting Tory policies.\n\"This looks like an abuse of official resources and ministers must urgently clarify how this was agreed and whether all correct procedures have been followed.\"\nIt's not the first time the Conservatives have been accused of using government money to promote their election campaign.

        "MIAMI, Florida (Reuters) - David Beckham has less than a year before his new Major League Soccer team, Inter Miami, takes the field and is finally turning his focus to bringing in players with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo on his mind.\nWhen Beckham announced he would create an MLS franchise in Miami, five years ago, there was speculation that he would look to entice some of the biggest names in the game with talk of Messi or Ronaldo possibly ending their careers in Florida.\nBut, although Juventus forward Ronaldo is 34 and Barcelona\u2019s Messi will be 32 in June, former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder Beckham knows it will be tough to get them to move - even if he has not given up on the prospect.\n\u201cEveryone has their wish list - everyone does! But if you look at the way Leo and Cristiano are still playing, even at what you might think is the later stage of their careers, I don\u2019t see it ending for them,\u201d he told a small group of reporters.\nBeckham, who played for MLS side LA Galaxy later in his career, and his small staff are beginning the process of identifying players and seeking to bring them in for the 2020 season.\n\u201cAs an organisation, as a club, we are starting to look at players, and possibilities, at what is possible. We\u2019ve got a great team here and we\u2019ll start piecing the things together. But we have to do that quick because it\u2019s only a year away,\u201d he said.\nBeckham\u2019s contacts in the game will surely help him attract talent and he also needs to find a manager and coaching staff for his club.\nAmong those the 43-year-old former England captain has turned to for advice about his new role as an owner is former Manchester United chief executive David Gill.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been speaking to people over that time. People like David Gill, who is someone who has a huge amount of experience at Manchester United, asking him about the job he did there,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut there are also other clubs and football people I\u2019ve been around over my career and been able to have and gain experience from. I also have some great partners here in Miami, who understand the U.S market and the MLS.\nAs well as getting his club off the ground, including negotiating a deal for a training complex and stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Beckham has also joined his fellow \u2018Class of 92\u2019 United alumni including Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville, in taking a ten percent ownership stake in National League (fifth tier) English club Salford City.\nThe former midfielder says it is possible that the two clubs will co-operate, with academy and player development two areas that could see joint work.\n\u201cWho knows? With Salford the hard work has been done over the last few years, with bringing the club up to the level they\u2019ve got to now.

        "The White House announced the other day that First Lady Michelle Obama would attend Monday's ribbon-cutting ceremony at the newly refurbished galleries for American art at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Why? The arts community has expressed considerable hope that the new administration will be active arts participants, focusing the kind of attention that hasn't been seen from Washington in decades. And, indeed, according to the news release, Obama's visit is being staged \"to demonstrate her interest in and support for the arts.\"\nReally? Is that what a visit to the Met will demonstrate?\nNew York City is the nation's No. 1 tourist destination. After Times Square, the Metropolitan Museum is the city's No. 1 tourist attraction. The first lady will be doing what 4.5 million people, mostly out-of-town visitors, did last year. The city's tourism industry will surely be thrilled at the demonstration of support. But for the struggling arts infrastructure elsewhere across the nation, which doesn't rely on tourist hordes, the New York event is pretty much a snooze.\nLast month the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., opened its new American art galleries. On May 30, the Huntington Library and Art Galleries in San Marino will open its new Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art. In the fall of 2010 the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston will open its new American art wing. Yes, it's a busy 18 months for museums' historical collections of home-grown painting and sculpture. If Michelle Obama turned up at any of those ribbon cuttings, we'd certainly have some authentic evidence of arts support.\nBut at the country's leading cultural tourism destination? Not so much.\nDon't get me wrong. The Met is swell, and so is the first lady. I just think there's a message problem here.\nThe desultory gesture doesn't match significant words with savvy deeds. This particular media stunt is sort of like the president going to a Lakers game and expecting sports reporters to fall all over themselves waxing poetic about a national demonstration of support for struggling basketball. Visiting the Met is the sort of thing noted arts supporters Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Reagan did.\nSo here's a tip for the White House Office of Media Affairs, which doesn't quite seem to understand arts support in the United States: On Monday, do not under any circumstances let Michelle Obama have a photo-op in front of that Neo-Classical marble architectural facade reconstructed inside the central court of the Met's American wing. Martin E. Thompson's Branch Bank of the United States (1822\u201324) was originally located in Lower Manhattan at 15 1/2 Wall St., and what with all the current bank bailouts and investment Ponzi schemes and millions in taxpayer-funded CEO bonuses and that $1,400 John Thain wastebasket and such -- well, you get my drift. Media events can have unexpected consequences.",
        "\u201cHoneywell? What do they make?\u201d I was asked this question on more than one occasion before attending Honeywell\u2019s media day in Phoenix, Arizona a couple weeks ago. In so many words, the answer is \u201ceverything, really.\u201d Although Honeywell plays an integral part in the aviation industry, it is almost all behind the scenes.\nHoneywell Engine HTF7000, used in mid-sized business jets, in production. Image courtesy Honeywell.\nFrom nose to tail, Honeywell probably crams more components into a typical aircraft than any other firm. To the average passenger, Honeywell is probably known as the manufacturer of their home thermostat from 1972. In the aircraft, however, Honeywell manufactures auxiliary power units, engines, avionics, complex air conditioning systems, radar systems, critical safety systems, and even in-flight WiFi hardware.\nAt their facility located just outside of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Honeywell kicked off a two day media event to give journalists, bloggers, and industry players a close look at exactly what it does. At this facility, Honeywell manufactures its jet engines and auxiliary power units (APU), which are essentially smaller jet engines located in the tail of the aircraft to supply electrical power and compressed air to the aircraft when needed. Both the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family of aircraft use Honeywell APUs. The brand new Airbus A350 does as well, using Honeywell\u2019s largest APU ever.\nAfter a tour of production floor, it was time to see some of Honeywell\u2019s latest and greatest safety systems up close. That is when things really got interesting. The only way to make sure their new technology works in the real world is to test it in the real world, and this requires an aircraft. Enter the Honeywell Convair 580. Born a Convair 340 and delivered to United Airlines in 1952, this aircraft has been upgraded more times than can be counted to include upgraded engines and cutting edge avionics. Why a 1952 Convair, you ask? Honeywell says the strong aircraft packs an oversized nose, which is perfect for mounting 30 inch radar dishes you might find on a much larger aircraft.\nThe TCAS display on the flight deck. Image courtesy Honeywell.\nJust after lunch (bad idea), a group of about ten boarded the aircraft so Honeywell could demonstrate the enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) and traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS). The climbout from Skyharbor was bumpy, but the Convair is a strong bird and handles it well.\nSo, how exactly does Honeywell test its EGPWS? They point the plane at the side of a mountain, of course! A haunting voice shouting \u201cTERRAIN! TERRAIN!\u201d echoed through our headsets as a monitor at the front of the cabin filled with the red outline of a mountain. The pilots yank the control column and we soar over the top of the of the rocks. Yup, it works!\nCloser to the city, TCAS lit up with targets in all directions \u2013 this is busy airspace. Under real test conditions, Honeywell will send up a second aircraft and set the two on a collision course. Once the two aircraft get close enough, the system issues a resolution advisory to both aircraft to successfully avoid disaster. One aircraft climbs, the other descends. TCAS is one of the most critical safety systems on a modern airliner, silently watching the skies at all times.\nEven after landing, Honeywell was not done showing off its innovations. Runway incursions, where an aircraft enters a runway without proper clearance, is a frequent and stubborn issue which plagues the aviation industry. Be it a pilot unfamiliar with the field, language barrier, or low visibility, runway incursions happen all the time and are incredibly dangerous. After touching down on Skyharbor\u2019s Runway 25L, we had quite the taxi back to Honeywell\u2019s ramp. Just after making a right run, \u201capproaching 25R\u201d was announced over the headsets. There would be absolutely no confusion about which runway we were holding short of.\nBonus Video Content: Flying Onboard Honeywell\u2019s Convair 580.\nBe sure to watch at 4:55 to see some interesting audio and visual content.\nSynthetic vision turns a pilot\u2019s ordinary \u201cblue-over-brown\u201d attitude indicator into a 3D view of the terrain and nearby objects such as tall antennas and buildings. I took a simulator for a ride to see if the 3D view made any difference, and it was immediately clear that it did. Instead of a simple blue and brown screen, I could see high terrain ahead, which may just prevent disaster in a low visibility situation. When I turned the control column hard over to the left to perform an aileron roll (when in Rome\u2026), the screen transitioned from the 3D view back to the blue-over-brown view to de-clutter the view and simplify recovery. It was all quite impressive.\nAn iPad being used to test the feasibility of using a touchscreen to replace a standard FMC keyboard and display.\nHoneywell is also looking to simplify other aspects of the cockpit by introducing touchscreens and modernizing the flight management system (FMS), the clunky 1980\u2019s style interface which lets the pilot interface with the aircraft\u2019s computer. In a full motion simulator, Honeywell techs test how well pilots are able to operate touchscreens in turbulent conditions. So far, they have found that sensitive capacitive screens (like those found on an iPad) lead to inadvertent input, and does not translate well to flight deck use. At the same time, voice recognition is being tested to eliminate all touches and help keep pilots focused on flying the aircraft.\nOver the past couple of decades, innovations from Honeywell and other have helped bring down the number of crashes and incidents to all-time lows. However, accidents do still happen despite aircraft being loaded with high tech solutions. At the end of the day, pilots and technology need to work together, which is a whole other battle.\nUnless otherwise noted, all photos courtesy Jason Rabinowitz.\nI started out writing Technical manuals for Air Research and ended my career as a Senior Logistician 21 years later.

        "SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Learn the art of compromise with this boozy chocolate mousse recipe. This year, I turned to the ready-to-use cake mix from Betty Crocker. I added two tablespoons of Cointreau to the cake mix for extra flavour.\nThe chocolate mousse recipe is adapted from a Belgian friend's recipe and combined with the recipe from the eighth edition of The Professional Chef by The Culinary Institute of America. My friend's recipe does not contain cream, but I find whipped cream gives the mousse a smoother texture.\nAdd a dash of colour with fresh raspberries, blackberries, mint, store-bought whipped cream, and use a vegetable peeler to shave chocolate as a topping. Best to consume the chocolate mousse the next day.\n1. Heat a saucepan with water 3cm deep. Keep the heat on low, as the water should be simmering, barely boiling. Over the saucepan, place a metal bowl with the chocolate and butter. Stir to make sure the chocolate is melted evenly. Once the chocolate is melted, turn off the heat and set it aside to cool to room temperature.\n2. Add 1 tablespoon of the Cointreau and rum each to the chocolate mixture and stir. Set aside.\n3. Place egg yolks in a dry mixing bowl and beat for 30 seconds. Add sugar. Continue beating until the mixture is pale yellow.\n4. Add the chocolate mixture into the beaten egg yolks. Add the salt and stir through. Set aside.\n5. Place egg whites in a dry mixing bowl. Whisk the egg whites into soft peaks.\n6. Pour the whipping cream into a dry mixing bowl. Whisk at low speed for a minute, then increase the speed. Whisk until soft peaks form.\n7. Fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture.\n8. Fold the cream into the chocolate mixture.\n9.

Other businesses scheduled to open in the coming months include All City Riders cycling gym; MidiCi pizza restaurant; Insight Coffee; All Good clothing store; and Kodaiko Ramen & Bar, a new restaurant from Bill Ngo, the leading force behind Kru sushi.\nFirst approved by the City Council in 2010, the 700 block development includes 137 apartment units and a row of new shops and restaurants. The project once stalled over a legal fight between the city and state over redevelopment dollars earmarked for its construction before work finally began in 2015.\n\"It's almost as if words can't describe what a feat it is to have the 700 block open for residents,\" said Councilman Steve Hansen, who represents the central city. \"Through all the delays, we're finally here.

        "Madison \u2014 The speed limit on some Wisconsin highways would rise to 70 mph, under a proposal approved by the state Senate on a voice vote Wednesday.\nThe bill would end Wisconsin's status as a lone island of 65 mph limits in the Midwest by increasing the maximum speed on stretches of interstates and some other four-lane highways that have overpasses, underpasses and ramps instead of other roads that directly cross traffic on the highway.\nThe proposal now returns to the Assembly, which passed a different version on a bipartisan vote in March.\nThe bill would mean that stretches of all interstates in Wisconsin could be marked up to 70 mph by Gov. Scott Walker's administration, as could stretches of state Highways 51, 53 and 151.\nThe proposal's lead sponsor in the Senate, Republican Devin LeMahieu of Oostburg, called it \"common sense legislation\" that left a final decision on the speed limits up to state transportation officials.\n\"This legislation authorizes, but does not require, the Department of Transportation to raise the speed limit on interstates and freeways where it is safe to do so,\" LeMahieu said.\nAll of Wisconsin's neighbors have maximum speed limits of 70 mph or higher, and Wisconsin is the only state between Pennsylvania and Oregon that doesn't have a maximum speed limit of at least 70 mph.\nSo far, Walker hasn't said whether he would sign the bill and the state DOT has not said how much time it would take to determine which highway stretches could rise to 70 mph and then change their signs accordingly. Spokeswomen for Walker and the DOT had no further comment on the Senate action beyond saying that their offices are monitoring the legislation.\nUntil now, opponents have blocked the proposal's passage in Wisconsin by arguing that there would be inevitable safety effects from allowing the higher speeds. But a compromise among GOP lawmakers cleared the way for the proposal to move forward by ensuring that highways with at-grade crossings for intersecting roads or even driveways couldn't be cleared for 70 mph speeds.\nAAA Wisconsin has argued that the speed limit should not be changed in Wisconsin, particularly for heavy trucks, because an increase of 5 mph could lengthen the stopping distance for those vehicles by as much as 100 feet, or 20%. The motorists group cites federal data showing that large trucks were involved in 7.4% of fatal crashes in Wisconsin in 2012, while Minnesota and Iowa \u2014 which allow trucks to travel 70 mph on rural highways \u2014 had rates of 10% and 13.2%, respectively.\nDemocrats such as Rep. Dan Riemer of Milwaukee have said that they won't vote for the bill until they see strong evidence that it won't make the state's roads more dangerous, arguing that the proposal's supporters owe that to the public.\n\u25a0Broaden existing state law to make it a felony to physically harm or threaten to harm a current or former law enforcement officer, prosecutor or judge because of an official action taken by those authorities or their colleagues. The proposal goes to the Assembly.\n\u25a0Allow search warrants to be issued so that blood can be drawn for testing from a driver who is suspected of a first-time intoxicated driving offense. Under U.S. Supreme Court rulings, a failure to get a search warrant for a blood draw could affect a criminal case if the driver didn't agree to the test first.\nBut in Wisconsin, it's not possible currently to get a search warrant in first-time drunken driving cases. That's because search warrants are issued only in criminal investigations and Wisconsin is the only state in the nation in which first offense drunken driving on its own is a municipal violation, similar to a speeding ticket, and not a crime.\nIn approving the measure on a voice vote, the Senate sent it to the Assembly.\n\u25a0Make it a crime for a person to falsely claim that he or she received military honors in the absence of such awards. The Assembly will take the proposal up next.\n\u25a0Make it a misdemeanor to put a global positioning device on people or their vehicle without their consent. There would be exemptions for law enforcement; parents and guardians using the devices to track their minor children; businesses that monitor where their vehicles go; and lien holders who use the devices to find vehicles for repossession.\nThe Senate passed the measure on a voice vote Wednesday. The Assembly approved it in February.",
        "On paper, it's a wonder the Raiders and New York Giants are even going through the trouble of playing.\nOne would be hard-pressed to find a more mismatched game statistically than this one. Not just because the Giants are 4-0 and the Raiders are 1-3.\nThe Giants defense is No. 1 in yards per game allowed (232.2 average) and passing yards allowed (115). The Raiders' offense is last in yards gained (208.5) and passing yards (119.8).\nThings aren't much closer in reverse. The Giants are fifth in scoring (26.8), the Raiders 31st (10.5).\nThe Giants' offense is tied for fourth in yards per game at 401. The Raiders defense is 18th at 356.8 yards per game allowed.\nOn and on it goes. So is it any wonder why Raiders coach Tom Cable says the Giants are a team every other team seeks to emulate?\n\"You really have to respect what they've done there and what they have going,\" Cable said. \"Everybody in football would like to get those two units to be similar to their style.\"\nThe great equalizer could be whether Giants quarterback Eli Manning plays. He missed practice Wednesday and Thursday with plantar fasciitis in his right foot. He practiced Friday, which makes it more possible that he will play.\nCoach Tom Coughlin said he won't make a determination on whether Manning plays until just before game time.\nDavid Carr, the No. 1 selection in the 2002 NFL draft, has taken all of the reps and would start if Manning can't play. Manning has started 82 straight regular-season games.\nThe Giants have other injury concerns.\nWhen Michael Boley was diagnosed with a torn meniscus and had to undergo surgery Tuesday, it was a surprise to nearly everyone. But at least one guy was prepared for it.\nThat's Chase Blackburn, the backup linebacker who, it seems, can fill in at any of three positions. When Boley missed the opener while serving a suspension, it was Blackburn who stepped in.\n\"I'm ready to play any time there's an opportunity,\" Blackburn said. \"I had one Week 1 and I'm ready to go back again.\"\nBlackburn technically will replace Boley in the starting lineup, but in reality it will take several people to replace what Boley was able to do. Losing him creates a chain reaction of change throughout the defense.\nBecause Boley is such an athletic linebacker, he was able to stay on the field in sub packages and help with pass coverage. Now the Giants will likely take the linebacker off the field in those situations and replace him with safety Michael Johnson as the nickel linebacker.\n\"That was the thing about (Boley) coming in: We knew he was going to be a linebacker who could stay in when we did go sub,\" Johnson said. \"He could stay in and play coverages where normally we used to put a defensive back in.\"\nThat means safety Aaron Rouse, who joined the team two weeks ago after Kenny Phillips was put on injured reserve, will likely play more against the Raiders than he did in the past two weeks.\n\"We've got some of our defensive back guys back,\" defensive coordinator Bill Sheridan said. \"Kevin Dockery is back and Aaron Rouse is ready to play. So we'll be all right depth-wise.\"\nBesides Boley, the Giants also are expected to be without Bryan Kehl, a weakside linebacker who fractured a finger last Sunday and had screws inserted this week. That leaves them with two players at that position: Blackburn and Gerris Wilkinson. In a pinch, the Giants also might consider Jonathon Goff or even think about moving Danny Clark from strong side to weak side, where he played when he arrived last summer.\n\"Outside backers flip around and can play different spots,\" Coughlin said.\nThat would leave rookie Clint Sintim, who appears to be healthy and available for the first time, on the strong side.",

This is particularly bad timing since food banks, disaster-relief organizations and other charities need our help now more than ever.\nDonate your time. Charities always gladly accept cash, but many run on shoestring budgets with minimal staff, so your time and expertise may be just as valuable. Numerous organizations can match you up with local charities that suit your interests, including Network for Good (www.networkforgood.org), Volunteer Match (www.volunteermatch.org) and Volunteer Solutions (www.volunteersolutions.org).\nAlthough you can\ufffdt take a federal income-tax deduction for your time, you can deduct mileage and certain expenses related to your volunteer activities at IRS-qualified, tax-exempt organizations. IRS Publication 526 explains how tax deductions for charitable contributions work and Publication 78 lists all IRS-approved organizations at www.irs.gov.\nMake sure any non-profit organizations to which you donate are well run and contribute at least 75 percent of contributions they receive to programs that serve their beneficiaries, as opposed to being spent on their own salaries and expenses. Several online rating services can help you research potential recipients of your generosity, including www.charitynavigator.org, www.guidestar.org and the Better Business Bureau www.give.org.\nClean out your closets and donate unneeded clothes, appliances, furniture and other items to non-profit organizations that sponsor thrift shops, like Goodwill Industries (www.goodwill.org) or your local religious or AIDS service organizations. Just be sure they\ufffdre on the IRS-approved list above.\nMany organizations accept donated frequent-flyer miles. One great program, the Make a Wish Foundation (www.wish.org), estimates it needs over 2.5 billion miles a year to fulfill the travel needs of the sick children they help. Check airline Web sites for links to organizations that accept miles.\nLocal food pantries and homeless shelters always need food contributions, especially around the holidays. Many also will accept and distribute toiletry items, so the next time you buy two-for-one toothpaste, set one tube aside for a needy family.\nAdopt a family. Numerous social and religious organizations sponsor programs that will align you with a family in crisis. You can provide services as wide-ranging as helping them to pay rent to educational tutoring to playing Santa Claus for homeless children.\nTap your employer. Many companies will match a portion of their employees\ufffd donations to IRS-approved non-profit organizations or educational institutions. Ask your Human Resources department if your company offers such a program.\nAlso, be wary. This is particularly true of unsolicited calls or e-mails seeking contributions to organizations that sound legitimate but may not be.\nVisit the organization\ufffds Web site independently, not through an e-mail link. Look them up on the online rating services mentioned above. And never give out your credit card number or personal information unless you initiated the contact yourself.\nOne last suggestion that won\ufffdt cost a dime: Donate blood. I can\ufffdt think of any better way to literally save lives.\nJason Alderman directs Visa\ufffds financial education programs.

        "Jenson Button, right, and Lewis Hamilton finished first and second for McLaren at the Chinese Grand Prix in April.\n(CNN) -- Jenson Button's McLaren team hope that improvements to his car can help the world champion repeat his 2009 Spanish Grand Prix success as the Formula One circuit returns to Europe this weekend.\nThe British driver triumphed last year while with the former Brawn team at a Barcelona circuit where McLaren, currently top in the constructors' table, have won only once in the past nine years.\nButton leads the drivers' standings by 10 points from Nico Rosberg of Mercedes after two wins from the opening four races, including victory in China three weeks ago.\nWhile the volcanic ash cloud affecting European airspace delayed the teams' return from Shanghai -- causing problems for the likes of Virgin, who have been able to build new fuel tanks for only one of their two cars -- McLaren have had time to make upgrades that should boost the hopes of Button and cohort Lewis Hamilton.\n\"In recent years, we've produced successful cars with inherent performance characteristics that enable them to perform better in slower corners,\" team principal Martin Whitmarsh told reporters.\n\"While we haven't overlooked high-speed performance, it's not typically been our strongest area -- and that might explain our recent loss of form around Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya.\n\"For 2010, however, we feel we have a car that generally excels in high-speed corners, and while that in itself, isn't enough to suggest a complete reversal of our recent fortunes in Spain, we feel that the useful upgrades we're bringing to this race, which include new front and rear wings, will help us consolidate our position among the leaders and, hopefully, enable us to close the gap to the cars at the front.\"\nButton won from pole position last year, and is looking forward to the European leg of the calendar.\n\"It's a relatively high-speed circuit, and one that's quite enjoyable to drive -- provided your car is working properly,\" the Englishman said. \"There are some fast corners, but the majority of the track is made up of pretty long corners where you really need the car to do all the work. It's a circuit that really rewards precision, and punishes aggression.\n\"Fortunately, our car does seem to have a very good neutral balance in the high-speed corners -- it's probably the most impressive aspect of the car -- and we went well during pre-season testing, so I think we go into this weekend feeling pretty well prepared.\n\"Finally, I'm looking forward to returning to Europe. It's been an incredibly exciting series of flyaway races, but I think everybody in Formula One looks forward to racing closer to home, back in the sport's heartland.\"\nHamilton, who was second in Shanghai, qualified 14th for last year's Spanish race but still managed to finish ninth.\n\"We've got a couple of fairly significant upgrades coming for this race. And while it would be naive to think that these will move us up the pecking order -- because almost all the teams produce a major bodywork update for Barcelona -- we're optimistic that they'll once again help us to bridge the gap to the leading cars,\" the 2008 world champion said.\n\"If it's a dry race, then, realistically, I think it's going to be harder for us to be up at the front. As we did in China, we'll be putting additional emphasis on qualifying -- it will be more important than ever in Barcelona as, traditionally, it's always been a track where overtaking is very difficult.\n\"Given that most cars will only be stopping once, we have less scope for passing, so a good grid position will be vital here.\"",

        "Jeremy Tucker is leaving the top marketing position at Nissan North American to \u201cpursue other opportunities,\u201d according to the automaker.\nA well-placed source says Tucker, who was vice president, Nissan marketing communications and media, was fired. However, Tucker describes it as a \"mutually agreeable parting.\"\nSales at the automaker have been lackluster and there has been some discontent among dealers about the brand\u2019s lack of national advertising, according to another source. The automaker\u2019s total calendar year 2018 U.S. sales were down 6.2% compared to the prior year. Nissan division sales were down 6.6%.\nReplacing Tucker effective April 1 is Allyson Witherspoon, currently general manager, global brand engagement, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. who will return to North America from Japan for the position, which is based in Tennessee. Witherspoon is the second woman to become the top marketer at Nissan North America. Janet Thompson was vice president of marketing at Nissan North America Inc., Nissan and Infiniti Divisions from June 2004 to September 2007.\nTucker says he will stay on until later in April so there is a smooth transition for Witherspoon, who has been his global counterpart for Nissan marketing.\nTucker notes that Witherspoon\u2019s international experience will serve her well.\nWhile Nissan moved several other non-marketing executives around, Tucker is the only executive reported to be leaving the company.\nTucker has been in the position for four years and seven months. He was instrumental in arranging for several high-profile deals between Nissan and Disney, including a well-received effort tying the Nissan Rogue to the \"Star Wars\" franchise. Previous to Nissan, Tucker spent two years at the Walt Disney Co. and seven years at PepsiCo.\nWitherspoon has been in her current position in Japan for two years. She has handled global marketing and creative strategy and validation of local marketing communications executed across seven global regions and 40 markets.\nPrevious to Nissan, she spent three and a half years at Infiniti Motor Co., Nissan\u2019s luxury division, lastly as director of marketing communications and media, and two and a half years at Havas Worldwide. She was also global business director for Volvo in Amsterdam.\nWitherspoon's previous positions at global marketing firms included direct support to a number of luxury automotive manufacturers including BMW North America and Mercedes-Benz USA. She spent most of her early career as an assistant vice president of Ansira, a marketing consultancy whose clients included American Honda Motor Co. in addition to Mercedes-Benz.",
        "When Thomas Pogge travels around the world, he finds eager young fans waiting for him in every lecture hall. The 62-year-old German-born professor, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the philosopher John Rawls, is bespectacled and slight of stature. But he\u2019s a giant in the field of global ethics, and one of only a small handful of philosophers who have managed to translate prominence within the academy to an influential place in debates about policy.\nA self-identified \u201cthought leader,\u201d Pogge directs international health and anti-poverty initiatives, publishes papers in leading journals, and gives TED Talks. His provocative argument that wealthy countries, and their citizens, are morally responsible for correcting the global economic order that keeps other countries poor revolutionized debates about global justice. He\u2019s also a dedicated professor and mentor, at Yale University \u2014 where he founded and directs the Global Justice Program, a policy and public health research group \u2014 as well as at other prestigious institutions worldwide. By Pogge\u2019s own count, he\u2019s taught 34 graduate seminars, given 1,218 lectures in 46 countries, and supervised 66 doctoral dissertations.\nBut a recent federal civil rights complaint describes a distinction unlikely to appear on any curriculum vitae: It claims Pogge uses his fame and influence to manipulate much younger women in his field into sexual relationships. One former student said she was punished professionally after resisting his advances.\nPogge did not respond to more than a dozen emails and phone calls from BuzzFeed News, nor to a detailed letter laying out all the claims that were likely to appear in this article. Yale\u2019s spokesperson, Thomas Conroy, declined to comment.\nThe allegations against Pogge are an increasingly open secret in the international philosophy community, an overwhelmingly male field in which, many women say, pervasive sexual harassment is an impediment to success. But for the first time, confidential documents obtained by BuzzFeed News reveal the extent of the claims against Pogge.\nIn the 1990s, a student at Columbia University, where Pogge was then teaching, accused him of sexually harassing her. In 2010, a recent Yale graduate named Fernanda Lopez Aguilar accused Pogge of sexually harassing her and then retaliating against her by rescinding a fellowship offer. In 2014, a Ph.D. student at a European university accused Pogge of proffering career opportunities to her and other young women in his field as a pretext to beginning a sexual relationship.\nYale has known about these allegations, and others, for years. When Lopez Aguilar first reported Pogge for sexual harassment, she said, Yale offered to buy her silence with $2,000.\nEventually, a hearing panel did find \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that Pogge had acted unprofessionally and irresponsibly, noting \u201cnumerous incidents\u201d where he \u201cfailed to uphold the standards of ethical behavior\u201d expected of him. But the panel voted that there was \"insufficient evidence to charge him with sexual harassment,\" according to disciplinary records.\nMore recently, Yale received letters from concerned professors and students at other institutions providing further evidence of Pogge\u2019s alleged misconduct and asking Yale to reinvestigate. But Yale said those allegations were outside of its jurisdiction and that it would not reopen the case. Pogge is still at Yale, directing the Global Justice Program and teaching philosophy and international affairs classes on the New Haven, Connecticut, campus.\nWhen Lopez Aguilar first reported Pogge for sexual harassment, she said, Yale offered to buy her silence with $2,000.\nIn October 2015, Lopez Aguilar filed a federal civil rights complaint, alleging that Yale violated Title IX, the statute that holds schools responsible for eliminating hostile educational environments caused by sexual harassment. Lopez Aguilar is asking the government to investigate whether Yale has ignored the \u201cexhaustive attempts\u201d she and others have made to prove Pogge is a danger to female students.\nHer complaint also accuses Yale of violating Title VI, which prohibits race discrimination, on the grounds that Pogge specifically targets foreign women of color who are unfamiliar with how to navigate power in the United States.\nThe claims against Pogge pose critical questions about how universities manage the power dynamic between faculty members and students.\nBut they also raise questions that are more, well, philosophical.\nCan someone fight tirelessly to balance the inequities of global power while at the same time abusing his own power? And can a discipline built on the quest to describe a just society \u2014 and suffering from a major diversity problem \u2014 afford to ignore these issues?\nPogge, then 56, and Lopez Aguilar, then 21, started corresponding about her thesis. Emails obtained by BuzzFeed News show that Pogge chided Lopez Aguilar for being too formal with him.\nShe told herself it was normal to discuss her thesis on a bike ride with him and at his home, alone.\nLopez Aguilar said she felt a little uncomfortable, but chalked it up to cultural differences. So she told herself it was normal to discuss her thesis on a bike ride with him and at his home, alone. She thought it was strange that he wanted to crash at the Washington, D.C., apartment where she planned to live with her boyfriend over the summer \u2014 Pogge was \u201cvery tired\u201d of wasting grant money, he explained \u2014 but she told him he was more than welcome.\nPogge also asked her to be his interpreter during a conference in Chile shortly after graduation, adding that she could stay in a hostel or was \u201cwelcome\u201d to stay in his hotel room if she was \u201ccomfortable doing so; we can upgrade the room.\u201d Lopez Aguilar said she didn\u2019t want to make demands, so she offered to sleep on a cot or bring a sleeping bag, but she always expected that he would book them in separate rooms. When she arrived at the hotel, she found that there was only one, but still didn\u2019t think it was her place to object.\nLopez Aguilar said she tried her best to get through the trip, but one night as she sat at a desk translating documents, she felt Pogge slide in behind her on her chair, press his erection against her and grab her breast.\nShe fled the room but had nowhere to go, she would later tell Yale. When she came back, Pogge said nothing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something not natural all of a sudden,\u201d she frantically Gchatted to her boyfriend. \u201cI'm not feeling comfortable.\u201d She asked him to stay online as she slept.\nOn the flight back to the United States, Pogge fell asleep with his head in Lopez Aguilar\u2019s lap. She said she couldn\u2019t wait to leave him at baggage claim. But he was coming to stay with her in D.C. in just a few days, and she said she felt too intimidated to refuse him.\nThe visit was awkward. Nervous that her fellowship was in jeopardy, Lopez Aguilar said, she tried to change the tone with some effusive emails.\nIn July, she asked Pogge for a \"theoretical\" document she could show to a landlord to prove she was employed by the Global Justice Program. He wrote her one on Yale stationery, which stated she would start on Sept. 1, 2010, and would earn $2,000 per month.\nStill, she said, she felt anxious about the arrangement, so she showed up to work two days ahead of that date \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her employment.\nLopez Aguilar said she was crushed: As she saw it, she had withstood months of unwanted, unprofessional behavior from a man she believed to be her mentor, only to be fired under bewildering circumstances after she had rejected his advances. She decided to report Pogge for sexual harassment. But she didn\u2019t know whom to report him to. And according to her recent federal complaint, Yale officials told her she had no recourse since she was no longer a student and hadn\u2019t ever truly been an employee.\nThe federal government has said that it\u2019s illegal to use conditional nondisclosure agreements in sexual harassment cases. But Yale treated Lopez Aguilar\u2019s report as a workplace dispute, ignoring her claims of sexual harassment, her recent complaint states.\nShe signed the agreement. She said she didn\u2019t think she had any recourse.\nShe told Yale that Pogge had slid behind her, but she did not specifically mention an erection, or his hands on her breasts.\nThe following spring, however, 16 other current and former students filed a Title IX complaint with the Department of Education claiming that Yale had failed to properly address their sexual misconduct claims. A formal investigation was opened. (It concluded that Yale had underreported incidents of sexual violence \u201cfor a very long time,\u201d among other violations.) Their complaint had nothing directly to do with Pogge, but it motivated Lopez Aguilar to try again.\nThis time, she said, she was told the nondisclosure agreement she signed was not actually binding. So Lopez Aguilar filed an official sexual harassment complaint to Yale on May 17, 2011. She brought up the harassment accusation that Pogge told her he faced at Columbia, and wrote out her own side of the story in painstaking detail. She would later say she stopped short of the whole truth on one point: She said that in their hotel room in Chile, Pogge had slid behind her in the chair so that his \"pelvic area\" touched her buttocks, but she did not specifically mention an erection, or his hands on her breasts.\nYale assigned an arbitrator and hearing panel to the case that fall.\nPogge told the hearing panel that he had indeed been accused of sexual harassment at Columbia, but that the allegation was false. Yale knew about it, he said, and an official \u201ctook great pains to investigate what had happened\u201d before offering him a job.\n\u201cThis was by far the most traumatic event of my life, as can be seen, for instance, from the gap it left in my publication record,\u201d Pogge wrote.\nYale University's New Haven campus.\nAs for his interactions with Lopez Aguilar, Pogge insisted he did not have \u201cany non-professional relationship with or intentions toward\u201d her, the arbitrator wrote in her report. Lopez Aguilar was a weak student, he said, who from the beginning had worked toward \u201crelaxing the terms of the relationship.\u201d He never meant to offer her a paying job, he wrote; she knew he was just trying to help her stay in the U.S. after college. Pogge never forced Lopez Aguilar to share a hotel room in Chile, he continued, or made any sexual comments or advances to her. He acknowledged that they watched a movie together on a bed and he slept in her lap during the flight home, but said both activities were Lopez Aguilar\u2019s suggestion.\nGiven his \u201ccontribution of frequent flier miles to her trip to Chile and given my knowledge that her apartment was large and shared with her boyfriend,\u201d Pogge wrote, he thought it was fine to accept her hospitality in D.C.\nHe said Lopez Aguilar knew the letter he gave her to show her landlord was fake, and asked the panel why he would have \u201cagreed to supply the non-genuine job offer needed to solve her apartment problem\u201d if he had \u201cbeen disposed to retaliate\u201d against her after their trip to Chile.\nA hearing panel found \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that he \u201cfailed to uphold the standards of ethical behavior\u201d for a mentor.\nThe fact-finding arbitrator, a former judge who teaches at Yale, also spoke with students who said Pogge was perfectly professional.\nPogge\u2019s behavior was \u201cat best confusing coming from a charismatic professor who was able to offer her an affiliation in an organization that interested her intensely, and at worst likely to make this young woman think that she was likely to be asked to have a close and perhaps intimate friendship,\u201d she wrote.\nShe found his anger at Lopez Aguilar after she showed the letter he wrote her to the Global Justice Program \u201cdisproportionate to the events,\u201d and said he provided \u201cno credible explanation\u201d for ever having said he would pay her a salary.\nBut the judge also said that Lopez Aguilar had minimized her own role in sending Pogge \u201cintimate\u201d emails and proposing meetings that resembled dates, and that those cheery emails after their trip made her story less credible. \u201cIt appears to me that Complainant's reaction at being out of Respondent's good graces in the fall of 2010 has led her to recast some of the earlier interactions,\u201d she wrote.\nA subsequent hearing panel found \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to determine whether Pogge had made direct sexual comments or advances to Lopez Aguilar, but \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that he \u201cfailed to uphold the standards of ethical behavior\u201d expected of him as her mentor and employer.\nIn the end, however, the panel decided his actions did not constitute sexual harassment.\nOnly one note went into Pogge\u2019s permanent record. It was for misuse of Yale stationery.\nAfterward, Lopez Aguilar \u201cfell apart,\u201d she said. A psychologist later diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder linked to Yale\u2019s handling of her claims. In 2012, Lopez Aguilar hired Ann Olivarius, a lawyer and Yale alum who had also been the plaintiff in the first Title IX sexual harassment lawsuit against a university.\nHer legal team found Columbia professors with direct knowledge of the sexual harassment proceedings that Pogge faced there.\n\"I falsely assumed that the man who calls affluent westerners human rights violators would treat women with dignity.\"\nThe author never named the philosopher, but described him as \u201can old man, occupying a powerful place in academia, who has a penchant for young, inexperienced women.\u201d Commenters quickly guessed it was Pogge, and someone put Lopez Aguilar in touch with the writer.\n\"Aye,\" a graduate student who had an affair with Pogge. She published an anonymous essay about it on the website Thought Catalog.\nAye, a philosophy Ph.D. student from one of the poverty-stricken Asian countries Pogge has written about, first met Pogge at a conference in Europe the year before she wrote the Thought Catalog essay. (She is identified by a nickname at her request.) Then 29, she said she was surprised when he tracked down her email address afterward, but told him she was a huge fan of his work. \u201cI will always be cheering you from afar,\u201d she wrote.\nAye wrote the Thought Catalog essay in a rage, she said. A recording obtained by BuzzFeed News shows that Pogge read it closely.\n\u201cYeah, true, sure, everything is true,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat's how you experienced it. I'm sure that you are an honest person, that you're trying to depict it as accurately as you can.\"\nAye and Lopez Aguilar said they saw a pattern to their experiences, and joined forces to see if they could find other young students he had treated similarly.\nOne was a young Chinese student whom, Pogge told Aye, he had a relationship with. In a recording obtained by BuzzFeed News, he admitted that he wrote the woman a letter of reference despite never having had any real \u201cintellectual contact\u201d with her.\nResponding to the growing rumors about Pogge, Yale philosophy professor Jason Stanley made a public request for anyone with knowledge of Pogge\u2019s professional misconduct, \u201ceven students in his areas at other universities,\u201d to contact Yale\u2019s Title IX coordinator, Stephanie Spangler. Aye wrote in to share her story and the information about other women. But Spangler told her it did not fall under Yale\u2019s jurisdiction.\nSeparately, Lopez Aguilar said, Yale\u2019s legal department informed her that the time during which she could have taken legal action had expired \u2014 and that she was a weak witness, given that she had previously taken medication for anxiety and acknowledged changing her account of that night in the hotel.\n\u201cThank you for your expression of concern for the safety of the Yale community,\u201d Spangler wrote.\nUniversities have many reasons to keep sexual harassment investigations secret, including laws in some states that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information, and they take great pains to do so. But in recent years, there have been calls for greater transparency as an increasing number of schools have been accused of shielding high-profile faculty from the consequences of their actions.\n\u201cWe're currently going through a fraught and difficult period, as people are learning that they can't get away with the behaviors that used to be taken for granted as normal,\u201d said Jennifer Saul, the philosophy department chair at the University of Sheffield and editor of the blog What Is It Like to Be a Woman in Philosophy, which has posted anonymous stories about sexual harassment since 2010.\nThe relatively small field of philosophy has been rocked by sexual harassment scandals at least three times over the past two years, as male philosophy professors at the University of Miami, the University of Colorado, and Northwestern University resigned after being accused of misconduct by students.\nPhilosophy has a pervasive gender gap. The percentage of philosophy Ph.D.s who are women is lower than 30%, less than in most of the physical sciences, and research has found that top journals publish and cite far fewer women than men. For female philosophers of color, the situation is even worse.\nWithin that climate, aspiring female philosophers can find unwanted sexual advances from a potential mentor particularly devastating.\nBecause of the contracts that govern their employment, tenured professors who face sexual misconduct claims are much harder to discipline than students accused of similar offenses. This discrepancy can make for complicated proceedings, especially as the federal government has put pressure on universities to investigate and resolve sexual harassment cases without giving much guidance about what to do when the accused is a tenured faculty member.\nSome universities have tried to get ahead of the problem by enacting blanket bans on romantic or sexual relationships between teachers and students. In 2010, Yale banned professors from pursuing \u201camorous relationships\u201d with undergraduates, noting they are \u201cparticularly vulnerable to the unequal institutional power inherent in the teacher-student relationship and the potential for coercion.\u201d But Yale didn\u2019t appear to question whether Pogge violated that policy in his relationship with Lopez Aguilar.\nAnother complicating factor is that the universities that adjudicate cases like this are not disinterested parties. Even a single star professor raises a department\u2019s profile, a fact that at least has the potential to influence decisions about discipline \u2014 or about hiring. \u201cBy adding a prominent scholar\" in the field of global justice, said Brian Leiter, a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago who writes the definitive blog on faculty appointments in the field, \u201cYale is then a magnet for students, whether in philosophy or political science, interested in these questions.\"\nLeiter stipulated that he did not know the details of Pogge\u2019s case, or the circumstances of his hiring. But he observed that as more of these once-secret accusations become public, professors may find themselves less insulated from the effects.\n\u201cThese days, someone who has been credibly publicly accused is not hirable,\u201d he said.\nBut the allegations against him have also traveled widely, in recent years, attracting attention in philosophy departments around the world. In 2014, a fundraiser for Lopez Aguilar\u2019s legal costs raised over $7,000.\nBuzzFeed News spoke with three women who have worked alongside Pogge, all of whom said he had treated them with respect. One said she felt personally injured by rumors to the contrary. They would not speak on the record.\nBut others said the news has forced them to re-evaluate the contemporary they thought they knew.\nShe added, \"We take our job to be giving students the tools to make good ethical decisions. But of course, a philosopher can know what the tools are, and still be bad at using them.\"\nNonetheless, some said they feel a personal responsibility to try and curb his influence.\n\"It breaks my heart to have to say it,\u201d said Christia Mercer, a former colleague from the Columbia philosophy department, \"but it's clear that Thomas uses his reputation as a supporter of justice to prey unjustly on those who trust and admire him, who then \u2014 once victimized \u2014 are too intimidated by his reputation and power to tell their stories.\"\nMartha C. Nussbaum, a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Chicago, said that since learning about the accusations Pogge faced at Columbia, she has chosen not to invite him to conferences and workshops. She also declines to participate in projects he is involved in.\n\u201cThe time has come for a public investigation,\u201d she wrote in a statement that Lopez Aguilar\u2019s lawyers later gave to Yale.\nRoxanne Heston, the director of the Hong Kong conference Pogge was scheduled to speak at, said they \"worked quickly\" to replace Pogge in the lineup after hearing of his alleged conduct. University of Queensland also quietly canceled his upcoming master class.\nThat investigation may soon commence. The Department of Education recently informed Lopez Aguilar that her civil rights complaint is still under review. And this month the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a separate government entity, said it would not conduct its own additional investigation, meaning the path is now clear for her to file a lawsuit of her own.\nBut Lopez Aguilar, now the spokesperson for a reformist political movement in Honduras, said she no longer holds out much hope that these processes will work in her favor. That\u2019s why she also hopes to force a broader conversation about the way these cases play out, and the factors that might influence the way we view them.\nPogge uses philosophy as a powerful tool with which to solve global problems \u2014 a fact that greatly enhances the discipline\u2019s real-world credibility. Could that have inclined his fellow philosophers to tolerate behavior they would otherwise condemn? Or is the discipline simply sexist?\nFinally, what is our collective responsibility \u2014 to put it in the language of global ethics \u2014 when the flawed humans we enshrine as intellectual heroes are accused of being far from heroic?\nIn his writing, Pogge argues that the power imbalance between rich countries and poor countries is so great that poor countries cannot reasonably be said to \u201cconsent\u201d to unfavorable agreements between them.\nThis story has been updated to reflect that two of Pogge's speaking engagements were canceled once organizers learned of the claims against him.\nPogge released a statement on Saturday responding to certain allegations within this article.

        "Braided Puff Pastry Lentil Roast (clockwise from bottom), Medjool dates, Pumpkin Old-Fashioneds, Super Savory Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup, and Spinach Salad with Pear, Parmesan and Pepitas will warm your guests without putting anyone to sleep.\nI'm never happier than when my home is filled with delicious food and hungry loved ones. I know this is true for many avid home cooks; feeding friends and family brings us pure joy. Overworking our ovens and testing the limits of our tables, we nourish our souls even more than our guests' hungry stomachs, and the holidays are peak season.\nHaving a few friends over for a warm meal starts the season of gratefulness and giving on exactly the right foot (call it \"Friendsgiving\" if you must). Although an omnivore myself, a few of my dearest pals are vegetarian, so I created a menu in their honor featuring a meatless main dish that beats any turkey I've ever met.\nAs soon as I pulled the Braided Puff Pastry Lentil Roast from the oven, I knew the recipe was a winner. This sage-scented, nutty, vegetable-and-lentil loaf blanketed with a flaky golden crust and topped with a generous drizzle of caramelized onion gravy will win over even devout bird-lovers in the bunch.\nEnrobed in umami flavor, Super Savory Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup is like a bear hug from your favorite uncle. It's difficult to describe the toothsome chew of the cremini mushrooms and whole wild rice without using the word meaty.\nBy boiling the wild rice with baking soda, the flavorful browning process known at the Maillard reaction occurs at a lower temperature, creating a richly flavored broth that takes this soup over the edge. I'll be making this all winter long.\nMy secret to avoiding a Thanksgiving food coma is filling half my dinner plate with a green salad. Serve ripe golden pears, crunchy pepitas and luscious Parmesan nestled among tender baby spinach, and you'll still have plenty of space for heartier dishes while maintaining your upright posture. Dress with a classic balsamic vinaigrette that gets a bit of bite from horseradish mustard.\nNo November feast is complete without an appearance from the famous pumpkin, which finds its way into a cocktail rather than a pie in a festive twist on the old-fashioned. Shake up bourbon with orange liqueur and bitters, pureed pumpkin and real maple syrup, pour over ice and you've got dessert in a rocks glass, so classy.\nA few chewy Medjool dates in a bowl along with some roughly chopped dark chocolate do well to quell a sweet tooth, too. If pie is a must, pick one up at your favorite bakery and save your rolling pin for another day.\nIn this bustling season, start by taking a deep breath and opening your heart to the holidays. Bring loved ones together around nourishing, soulful food. Light a fire (or play a video of one of your TV). Listen to your favorite records. Get cozy and don't forget to soak up the moments.\nThis song list starts out slow and relaxed and moves into dance-worthy beats to fuel your friendly gathering all evening long.\nThis recipe is adapted from the vegan blog It Doesn't Taste Like Chicken.\n40 minutes.

If mixture seems dry or does not stick together, add 1 to 2 tablespoon vegetable broth.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out one of the puff pastry sheets into a 14-by-10-inch rectangle. With half the lentil mixture, form a tightly packed loaf down the middle of the pastry sheet, leaving 3 inches at top and bottom of loaf.\nFrom here, simply wrap pastry around all sides of lentil loaf and press to secure dough. Or, to create a braided wrap, use a sharp knife to cut 1-inch angled strips on each side of the loaf, leaving the top two ends intact to create two end flaps. Fold the top flap over the loaf, then alternate folding strips from the right and left over the loaf, working from top to bottom to create a braided effect. Finish by folding the bottom flap over the end of the loaf.\nRepeat with remaining pastry and lentil mixture to create a second loaf. Brush top of each with egg wash made from 1 beaten egg and 1 tablespoon water. Transfer loaves to a greased and floured baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven 40 to 45 minutes or until puff pastry is golden brown and fragrant.

        "A woman was so upset when she saw a photo of herself at a wedding that she made a promise to herself that she wouldn't be 23 stone at her own.\nNow, with the big day looming, self-proclaimed secret-eater Ria Wylie has shifted an impressive eight stone.\nThe 35-year-old, who has been with her partner for 14 years, says she started to pile on the pounds when she began working at a casino.\n\"As a child I loved sports and dancing, but I also loved food,\" the mother-of-one said. \"Being as active as I was at that time, it didn't really matter.\n\"But when I was 19, I started working at a casino as a croupier and had no time for sports and dancing.\n\"I spent long hours standing on the spot dealing cards often till the early hours.\n\"I began eating lots of rubbish and convenience foods. Without the activity, the weight started to pile on.\"\nMiss Wylie, from Ramsgate, says she had become a \"food addict\" and began to eat for the sake of it.\nShe added: \"I would secretly eat loads and loads. Instead of a couple of biscuits, I would eat a whole packet, always in secret.\n\"I didn\u2019t want people to see me eat and judge me, but I couldn\u2019t stop eating.\"\nThen, in 2013, Miss Wylie joined Weight Watchers with a few friends where she lost three stone.\nBut it wasn't long before her eating habits started up again.\n\"As soon as I had some emotional upheaval in my life, I went back to secret eating,\" she added. \"Only this time, the food addiction came with emotional eating too.\n\"I regained the three stone I had lost and another three stone on top, tipping the scale at my heaviest at 23 stone.\"\nIt was then at Miss Wylie's soon-to-be brother-in-law's wedding in March 2017 that the realisation came.\n\"I was horrified when the pictures came back,\" she said. \"There was one photo that I particularly hated.\n\"At that moment, I found the reason I wanted to make the change.\"\nSo Miss Wylie, this time in a different mindset, took up Weight Watchers again.\nShe added: \"Now I was ready. I put the photo on my fridge and went back to see wellness coach Cilla Muxlow at Harris and Hoole Broadstairs.\n\"By October 30, 2017, I had lost six stone and my partner proposed to me on the beach.\n\"I said yes, but in the back of my mind I knew I wanted to be smaller.\"\nBy the time Miss Wylie went for her first dress fitting, she had shrunk from a size 26 to 18.\nBut the dress she opted for included a 10% surcharge for plus sizes, and so she instructed them to get a size 14.\nMiss Wylie said: \"Last month when I went for another fitting for my dress, I had lost another three inches. That's eight stone since my journey began.\n\"I have no doubt that by April, when I go for the final fitting, that my dress will fit me perfectly.\n\"Maybe it will even have to be taken in a bit!\"",
        "As we come to rely more and more upon technology as a filter for our own life experiences, opportunities to bend reality abound. In theory, none of this is new. Ask anybody who has ever been on an online dating site and they will tell you what you see is not always what you get. Yet as technology plays an ever-increasing role as an intermediator for our daily experiences, those who control the technology can control our experiences. These changes have some significant implications for crime and social disorder in the 21st century.\nPhishing emails routinely take users to websites that appear to be genuine, but are in fact controlled by organized crime. Unsuspecting victims enter their personal banking details and are defrauded shortly thereafter. Pedophiles pretend to be teenagers, creating extensive fake online profiles in order to lurk in chat-rooms popular with young adults and to contact them. The creation of hundreds of thousands of blogs has turned the common man into a broadcaster, making it harder to judge the quality and veracity of the news. Is the story about the latest celebrity death real or is it rumor? The stories look real and official. Perhaps they are true? Of course one false story about a company\u2019s latest quarterly financials is enough to move markets and create a financial fraud costing victims billions of dollars.\nAs noted below, there are now a number of software applications that have been created to \u201cspoof\u201d or alter the caller identification on outbound mobile phone calls. While there are relatively benign uses of these technologies, (like playing jokes on other teenage friends), there can also be potentially deadly consequences.\nIn a phenomenon known as \u201cSwatting,\u201d criminals have been able to telephone police 911/emergency phone systems with spoofed telephone identities and reporting non-existent crimes resulting in the response of heavily-armed police SWAT units to various locations. In many cases, the offenders placed calls that appeared to come from legitimate addresses several states away and reported ongoing kidnapping or hostage scenarios in progress. Using these technologies, it was possible for a man in Ohio (USA) to use a spoofed phone identification to report a nonexistent hostage crisis, sending armed police bursting into the homes of innocent people.\nSpoofed phone numbers can also allow criminals access to the voice-mail systems of others. Since many mobile phone carriers do not require a password to enter one's voicemail box when calling from the account's associated phone number, a spoofed caller ID means criminals can listen to the phone messages of others without authorization. Valuable information could be obtained regarding pending business transactions, mergers and acquisitions and even personal medical data. Noted celebrities have also been accused of abusing this technology to gather gossip on rivals. From a social engineering perspective, telephone spoofing creates a powerful tool for the criminal mind.\nA spoofed telephone call to a company\u2019s IT-Department requesting a system password or the latest WiFi WPA key, is much more likely to be successful if the call appears to be emanating from within the company\u2019s own telephone infrastructure (internal to the company). Of course this particular technique is not new. Even 15 years ago, fax machines allowed their owners to enter any particular information they desired for identifying the machine and its originating phone number. What is changing however, is the pervasive use of technology and the widespread means to alter the user experience in real time.\nResearchers at Stanford University\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab have done extensive research on human behavior in virtual spaces and have presented a number of techniques to alter in an instant how our virtual selves are presented to others. The implications for future forms of criminality are noteworthy as evidenced by these experiments. For example, it is widely known that people in traditional human-to-human interactions tend to have greater trust in people who look, sound and act just as they do. That is to say, generally speaking, all things being equal, somebody would likely more trust and believe in somebody of their own race, gender or age, than somebody who differed in these characteristics. As such, it is possible to alter one\u2019s appearance, depending on the appearance of others.\nThus if I wanted to sell an individual a life insurance policy, I would have a better chance of making the sale if I emulated the physical characteristics of the person to whom I was selling. This is hard to do in real life, but easy to do with an avatar that mimicked a target\u2019s own movements and appearance in order to gain their trust. Con men have been doing this for years. Now, however, the entire process can be done in real time through computer scripting and AI.\nThe relevant \u201ctake-home\u201d message is that in the future, seeing something with your own two eyes and hearing it with your own ears, may not mean that it is real or actually occurred.\nEntertainers long deceased, such as Elvis, Marilyn Monroe and Humprey Bogart have been resurrected in digital form and are being used in commercial advertisements to sell a wide variety of products, often without the permission of the entertainer\u2019s estate. Since there is enough video and photographic footage of these famous individuals, their likeliness can be appropriated, or misappropriated as the case may be, and made to do or sell anything. As more and more non-celebrities, including your parents, children or spouse, post their own photos and videos online on sites such as Flikr, Picassa, Facebook and Youtube, what is to prevent an unscrupulous individual from taking them an repurposing them for criminal purposes, (such as threatening the rightful owner with the release of a highly realistic, verisimilitudinous pornographic creation unless financial extortion demands are met).\nRapid advances in virtual reality technologies will only exacerbate this problem. For example, researchers at the Stanford University VHI laboratory were able to show that children immersed in virtual reality environments were unable to distinguish between what happened in the real world and what happened in VR. The Stanford report entitled Virtually true: Children\u2019s acquisition of false memories in virtual reality, showed that when a realistic avatar of a child\u2019s own image was shown swimming undersea with a whale, the children believed and reported that in fact they actually did swim with a real whale. The subjects in the study did not experience the time with the whale as anything other than a real undersea play-date with an actual whale. This raises significant opportunities for the planting of false memories in child sexual abuse cases, among a wide variety of additional crimes.\nAs author Dean Koontz has noted, \"In a world that daily disconnects further from truth, more and more people accept the virtual in place of the real, and all things virtual are also malleable.\" Moving forward, technologies that alter reality will open the door to entirely new classes of crime as malicious actors deftly exploit the old adage that perception is reality.",
        "Agailjhara upazila unit Awami League had set 10:00am yesterday as the deadline for stamping 70 percent ballots in favour of the party-backed chairman candidate in the upazila polls.\nThe party men executed the plan in almost all the 38 polling centers in the upazila, forcing both the BNP-backed and AL rebel chairman aspirants to boycott the polls.\nParty insiders said AL strongman Abul Hasanat Abdullah, cousin of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, masterminded the plan to ensure victory for party favourite Golam Mortuja Khan in the election.\nThere was hardly any voter in most of the polling centres after 10:00am. However, there were supporters of Mortuja Khan in the centres.\nVery few villagers were seen on the streets of different villages in the upazila, where more than 55 percent voters are Hindus.\nSensing that the Hindus might vote for AL-rebel Jatindranath Mistry, the ruling party men intimidated the religious minorities in many areas, complained locals.\nFormer general secretary of the upazila unit AL Jatindranath has been expelled from the party for contesting the polls against party decision.\n\u201cBy 10:00am, we completed stamping 70 percent ballot papers,\u201d said an AL activist at Ratnapur union, preferring not to be named. \u201cI stamped more than 200 ballot papers, but could not cast my ballot,\u201d he added.\nThe Daily Star found his claim to be true as Abul Hossain, presiding officer at Gaila High School, around 11:30am said over 3,100 votes (69 percent) were cast by then out of the total 4,579 votes at his centre. No voters were present at the polling station at that time.\nVisiting nine polling centres in the upazila, this newspaper witnessed random stamping of ballot papers in favour of Mortuja Khan and AL-backed woman vice-chairman hopeful Malina Rani Roy.\nThe centres are Datterabad Govt Primary School, Beluhar Govt Primary School, Mollahpara High School, Ratnapur Govt Primary School, Madhya Shihipasha Govt Primary School, Sheral Bahumukhi High School, Gaila High School, Paisha High School and Choygram High School and College.\nLaw enforcers, presiding and polling officers were seen helping the AL men stamp the ballot papers. When journalists entered into the centres, they signalled at the AL men to leave the polling booths.\n\u201cJournalists are in our room. You [AL men] should go now,\u201d polling officer Rezaul Karim told the AL men at a polling booth at Madhya Shihipasha Govt Primary School.\nFreedom fighter Faruk Hossain was guiding AL men to stamp ballot papers at Beluhar Govt Primary School under Ratnapur Union of the upazila. Enquired about his act, he said he was rigging votes \u201cslightly\u201d as he liked Abul Hasanat Abdullah, also the local lawmaker.\nAsked about the large-scale vote rigging by the AL men, Nazrul Islam, a sub-inspector of police, said they had nothing to do except for helping the ruling party men. Most of the presiding officers echoed the views of the cop.\nMeanwhile, BNP-backed chairman candidate SM Afzal Hossain and AL-rebel Jatindranath Mistry boycotted the polls within an hour of opening the voting and demanded the upazila returning officer postpone the polls and hold a fresh election later freely and fairly.\nThe upazila unit BNP called a half-day hartal for today in the upazila protesting vote rigging by ruling party men, Afzal told reporters at a press conference at Agailjhara Press Club around 11:00am.\nAsked about the allegations of irregularities, AL-backed candidate Mortuja Khan said his two rivals resorted to a propaganda campaign against him sensing his victory. He claimed that yesterday's polls were free and fair.\nSenior Judicial Magistrate Mustafizur Rahman said they fined nine people for trying to rig the polls.\nDespite repeated attempts, The Daily Star could not reach Abul Hasanat Abdullah over the phone for his comment.",
        "Some do it in the comfort of home with a G&T to hand after a hard day at work. Others prefer it at the breakfast table over coffee; still more manage to tackle it on the train. But, wherever they are, those who know the pleasures it brings can be identified by the tell-tale combination of a furrowed brow, a well-sharpened pencil and a still sharper look in their eye.\nThe Daily Telegraph crossword - of which of course, I speak - has reached a milestone: tomorrow's will be the 25,000th. And yet, even as we celebrate its longevity, its future is by no means secure.\nSudoku, which many puzzle pundits thought would pass as quickly as a summer storm, has stubbornly endured, and with 5,472,730,538 possible combinations on a classic grid, it could be around for a while. But will the crossword?\nOur crossword editor, Val Gilbert, is uncertain: \"The Telegraph crossword has been going for 81 years and I think it will last a century. Beyond that, I don't know. If you took a train journey 20 years ago, everybody was reading a paper, now people get their news from the television or online. Few have time to sit and think about the crossword.\"\nOur leisure time is undoubtedly spent differently from that of early cruciverbalists. On the June day in 1925 when the first Daily Telegraph crossword was published, typical family entertainment might have included a game of whist or a radio play.\nTelegraph compiler Don Manley says it was the perfect environment for crosswords to flourish. \"I got my love of crosswords from my father; we didn't have a television and we'd sit together all evening solving them,\" he recalls. \"My one sadness is that I haven't managed to pass that love on to my son. There are so many rivals for children's attention now.\"\nAnd while television and the internet mean that younger people don't linger long over the back page, their lack of interest could also stem from a feeling that the clues, especially cryptic ones, require a depth of knowledge in the classics, literature and history that just isn't provided by the national curriculum.\n\"I think the only way we can secure a future for the crossword is to make sure we appeal to a younger audience, too,\" says Manley. \"We need to start writing clues that they would be able to solve. Some are just too obscure.\"\nThis might also explain why sudoku - for which the only background knowledge you need are the numbers one to nine - has such mass appeal. Hazel Norris, Chambers's senior editor of crosswords games and puzzles, says: \"There's been a lot of consternation in crossword circles about sudoku. Some fans think it will mean crosswords will die out, and there's no doubt that it's huge at the moment.\"\nBut she says that the new puzzle isn't the threat that crossword aficionados believe it to be. \"What we're finding is that the sudoku craze is making people realise how gripping puzzles are and leading them to try crosswords for the first time. Sales of crossword dictionaries are as good as ever.\"\nAnd there are other signs that the public is still hungry for the kind of brain teasers that characterise crosswords. Dan Brown puts his passion for planting clues down to a childhood spent working out anagrams and crossword puzzles. If as many of his fans develop a taste for them as relished his clues in The Da Vinci Code, then compilers had better get busy.\nBut Gilbert believes that crosswords have to evolve to survive. \"To my mind, the internet isn't being used to its full potential with crosswords,\" she says. \"You could have three-dimensional crosswords that would work on a cube - it would be a great new challenge for existing fans and might attract a new audience, too.\"\nIt's an idea that is beginning to take off; hundreds of online sites have emerged over the past few years, the Chambers Crossword Solver, which suggests solutions when you input the letters you know, is now available online and you can download crosswords for mobile phones and BlackBerrys.\nThere has even been an unexpected bit of celebrity endorsement for the old-fashioned paper variety: Hollywood \"bad boy\" Colin Farrell has apparently become hooked on the puzzles after a stint in rehab.\nNorris can see why. \"Once you've got the hang of the cryptic it is more addictive than sudoku,\" she says. \"People will never complete a sudoku grid and say: 'that was a great 1,7,9 today', but they'll go on quoting their favourite crossword clues for ever.\"\nDon Manley was born in 1945 and grew up in rural Devon. He believes he inherited the crossword \"gene'' from his father, who travelled between farms for work and would do a puzzle while drinking a pint en route.\nWhen he was 17, he created a puzzle for a competition run by the London Evening News. He won and received a cheque for \u00a32 2s. His first crossword was published in the Radio Times in 1964, while he was still a student.\nManley compiled crosswords for the Today newspaper after its launch in 1986. At his home in Oxfordshire, he was a neighbour of Colin Dexter and several other crossword enthusiasts, who all chivvied each other on.\nIn the mid-Eighties, his book, the Chambers Crossword manual, was published (a new edition is scheduled for October). \"Thirty-four years passed from when I first wrote to the Telegraph to the day one of my puzzles was finally published,' he says. ''By knocking on the door for long enough I finally found my way in.\"\nRoger Squires lives in Shropshire and inherited his love of words from his poet grandmother and his father. Born in Tettenhall in 1932, he joined the Royal Navy at 15 and then spent 11 years in the Fleet Air Arm.\nIn 1961, he survived a ditching off Ceylon by escaping from his aircraft 60ft under the sea. Aircrew played cards for money but he was barred because he was a member of the Magic Circle, so he began solving crosswords. He started compiling his own and his first appeared in the Radio Times in 1963.\nIn 1978, Squires became the Guinness Book of Records' \"World's Most Prolific Compiler\", a title he still holds, with more than 65,000 published crosswords in over 470 publications.\nSquires was crossword editor at the Birmingham Post for 22 years, and began compiling for The Daily Telegraph in 1986. He had stints on many other national and regional papers and his millionth clue appeared in The Telegraph in September 1989.\nIan Mawby was born in Newcastle in 1942 and now lives in Cambridgeshire. Aged 30, he became a professional racing driver and caught the eye of Lotus boss Colin Chapman. In 1973, Ian's brakes failed at 130 mph and he broke his neck in the crash. Although paralysed and confined to a wheelchair he still drives his 200 mph Mercedes.\nIn 2004, Ian sent a sample puzzle to The Daily Telegraph and his first puzzle was published in February 2005.\nHe wakes up almost every day with a clue ready-formed in his mind and jots down anything that strikes him as a good basis for others. He says his two careers have much in common. \"I risked life and limb to thrill my fans when racing, but I was astonished when I discovered that the thrill of knowing one of my puzzles was going to be published was far superior to motor racing.\"\n1 In 1999, Anetta Duel, who had tackled the Telegraph crossword for 56 years, wrote her will on the crossword, just before she died, aged 99. The will was accepted.\n2 The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle, who shot Aliens and the second Bridget Jones, was such a fan that he had the paper delivered on set every day, wherever he was.\n3 In 1994, a reader wrote in to point out that, four days before the Estonian ferry disaster, the crossword had included the words Estonia, Disaster and Master Mariner.\n4 Labour rebel Dennis Skinner - ''the beast of Bolsover'', completes the crossword every day.\n5 Two days before the Dieppe raid in 1942, in which 4,500 Allied soldiers were lost, the word ''Dieppe'' appeared in the crossword.\n6 In 1944, five top secret D-day code words appeared and MI5 investigated. Forty years later, it emerged that compiler Leonard Dawe, headmaster of the Strand School, had filled his grids with words suggested by his pupils, who socialised with American servicemen. None of them had known the significance of the words.\n7 The Daily Telegraph's annual crossword competition is held in memory of the legendary compiler Bert Danher, who died in 2002. The trophies are presented by Sir Paul McCartney, who was Bert's nephew and godson.\n8 Colin Dexter, creator of the crossword-loving Inspector Morse, selected compiler Roger Squire's clue \"Bar of soap\" (Answer: The Rover's Return) as a favourite.\n9 During World War Two, The Daily Telegraph held its first crossword competition. Hopefuls had to complete it under exam conditions. The winner - F H W Hawes of Dagenham - finished in under eight minutes. MI5 invited the entrants to work as code-breakers at Bletchley Park.\n10 When Saturday prize crosswords were introduced in 1928, the winners' lists included Stanley Baldwin, Sir Austen Chamberlain and Lord Russel of Killoween. The then Prince of Wales, who was \"not very good at solving crosswords\", never appeared, though his private secretary did.",
        "John Stamos is giving Once Upon a Time fans a little extra incentive to tune in to Galavant after Once goes on its mid-season break.\nABC is obviously hoping that Oncers will embrace a second fairy tale show even though Once Upon a Time in Wonderland failed to enchant Evil Regals and Ugly Ducklings. Luckily, Galavant is doing a great job casting its spell so far. According to ABC News, the musical comedy has used its magic to conjure up an appearance by John Stamos. He\u2019s set to guest star as a singing knight who will be a rival to the series\u2019 titular character.\nAccording to Broadway World, Stamos\u2019 rival will be played by the equally-dashing Josha Sasse. Sasse\u2019s hero character, Galavant, is a love-struck charmer who loses his ladylove Madalena (Mallory Jansen) when she\u2019s kidnapped by the evil King Richard (Timothy Omundson). After watching Omundson\u2019s antics in the trailer, it\u2019s clear that John Stamos won\u2019t play the only charming villain on the show.\nThis plot might sound somewhat similar to that of The Princess Bride, but rest assured that Galavant is no cheap knock off, and the hero\u2019s damsel in distress is no Princess Buttercup \u2014 she decides to ditch Galavant for a regal life of fortune and fame. Galavant seemingly gives up on the whole hero thing after losing his love, but a princess (Karen David) who needs help saving her kingdom just might help him get back into the groove of slaying dragons and saving the day.\nJudging from the Galavant trailer, John Stamos made a smart move by joining the ABC series. It features some delightfully Monty Python-esque moments, including Omundson gleefully singing about eye-stabbing and liberating heads from necks. John also should have no problem fitting in with the talented cast \u2014 he\u2019s done plenty of singing over the course of his career, and he\u2019s even starred in a TV musical series. John Stamos\u2019 stint as a singing dentist on Glee probably helped him score the Galavant role.\nAs The Inquisitr previously reported, ABC\u2019s other fairy tale series, Once Upon a Time, is getting tons of buzz for adding characters from Disney\u2019s Frozen to its cast. Galavant might not feature Disney characters, but it does have a few Disney connections \u2014 EP Dan Fogelman wrote the Tangled screenplay, and the series features songs by composer Alan Menken (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin) and lyricist Glenn Slater (Tangled, The Little Mermaid).\nAre you looking forward to seeing John Stamos as a knight in shining armor on Galavant?",
        "Chris Fearne is Malta\u2019s Minister for Health.\nIt is with a great sense of pride and satisfaction that on Friday 16 June I chaired the EPSC Council meeting of health ministers which served to conclude the ambitious health agenda that our Maltese team had set out to achieve during its term holding the Presidency of the Council of the EU.\nDealing with health issues at EU level is always somewhat paradoxical and fraught with complications. Health competence at EU level is limited and member states fiercely safeguard their competence to organise and manage their health systems.\nOn the other hand, health is one of the most important policy issues for European citizens and increasingly the need to do more together to attain common objectives more effectively and efficiently is being felt by a larger number of member states.\nMalta\u2019s choice of priorities was designed to reflect issues considered to be relevant to the national agenda as well as being a priority and concern for the vast majority of European Union member states.\nWe sought to ensure that there was a focus on public health issues as well as on health system concerns. I am delighted that after months of hard work, last Friday we adopted two sets of Council Conclusions namely; Council conclusions to contribute towards halting the rise in Childhood Overweight and Obesity and Council conclusions on Encouraging member states-driven Voluntary Cooperation between Health Systems.\nIn both these initiatives, we sought to emphasise a flexible and voluntary approach that will enable member states to work towards the stated objectives in the manner that fits best to their local contexts and aspirations.\nThis approach was the fruit of several months of careful planning and consultation with both member states as well as European NGOs and other stakeholders.\nThe consultation process started well in advance of the presidency and I personally took advantage of several informal meetings and events to discuss our plans and ideas with concerned stakeholders.\nDuring the closing plenary session of the European Health Forum Gastein in September 2016, I outlined the plans and objectives for the upcoming Maltese Presidency. The issue of transparency of medicines pricing and the need for member states to work together more closely on this issue was one of the more contentious policy proposals which I was determined to push forward.\nDuring the EPSCO Council I reported upon the outcomes attained in the area of pharmaceuticals during the Maltese Presidency.\nThe setting up of a permanent technical group to support the work of the Pharma Round Table and the signing of the Valletta declaration between eight member states pledging to work more closely together to cooperate in the improving access to medicines for their citizens are both good examples of cooperation.\nThe Valletta declaration is an example of the way in which member states are finding ways to step up their own cooperation mechanisms whilst the Pharma round table serves to reaching out to cooperate with industry. This is absolutely essential if we wish to register progress and move forward effectively in this policy area.\nThe feedback which my team obtained during the months preceding our presidency and in the technical meetings which we organised in Malta early on in our presidency was crucial to inform and fine tune our final proposals.\nThe support of other member states, the European Commission, WHO, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and European stakeholder organisations, was immensely valuable in assisting Malta to reach its goals for the presidency.\nI believe that the value of informal events bringing together a diverse array of experts, politicians and stakeholders together should not be underestimated. It is necessary for all players in the health sector to keep an open dialogue and exchange of views to enable results to be achieved.\nI consider the closure of our presidency not as the end of a process, but merely the beginning. Having been reconfirmed as Minister for Health in Malta, I am deeply committed to following up on the objectives set out in our Council Conclusions to ensure that these do not remain commitments on paper but serve to bring about positive changes to the health and well-being of European citizens.",
        "So many new rental condos are now hitting the Toronto market that competition is mounting among landlords to keep rents in line and tenants from flocking to the newest glass-and-granite boxes in the sky.\nThe 23,240 condo leases signed in the past year outstripped both new and resale condo sales combined, says a new report from condo market research firm Urbanation.\nTotal rental listings were up 21 per cent in the first quarter of this year alone as the number of new projects registering in the GTA skyrocketed by 42 per cent.\nWhile rents remain at record levels after five years of strong growth, all the new supply is already putting a damper on rental rate growth, which slowed to just 1.1 per cent in the first three months of 2015, an average of $2.37 per square foot.\nThat\u2019s despite another record quarter for leasing activity: some 4,938 condo units were rented from January to the end of March, up 11 per cent over a year ago, Urbanation said in its state-of-the-rental market report released Wednesday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a modest reduction in some key sectors of the rental market that have experienced rapid rent growth over the last five years,\u201d said Urbanation senior vice-president Shaun Hildebrand.\nVacancy rates, which have slumped to new lows of 1.1 per cent in the city core, are likely to slowly start climbing, the report notes. And the tenant search for the newest, shiniest thing means it may be tougher for landlords to hang onto tenants in even year-old or two-year-old buildings.\nAlready, says Urbanation, there\u2019s been some weakening of rents in half of the six major submarkets in the city, especially the densely populated CityPlace area south of Front St. at Spadina.\nRents there have declined an average of 4.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2015, year over year, to an average of $2.56 cent per square foot, says Urbanation.\nThe downtown core, where much of the new building is focused, has seen rents decline an average of 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, year over year, to $2.81 per square foot.\nUrbanation took a special look at Ice Condominiums in the South Core area, which a Maclean\u2019s article claims is full of empty units.\nUrbanation says it found that 91 per cent of nearly 300 units listed for rent over the last three quarters have been leased \u2014 a sign that rental demand remains \u201crobust\u201d in the city, even in the face of thousands of new condos coming on the market.\nA stunning 22,500 units have been completed since last June, with thousands more on the way, many of which are likely to end up as rentals, says Urbanation.\nCondos in the Harbourfront area saw rents climb 3.3 per cent in the first quarter, year over year, to an average of $2.53 per square foot, it says. The Entertainment District saw rents climb 2.1 per cent, to an average of $2.89 per square foot, and Mississauga City Centre rents were up 3 per cent, to an average of $2.04 per square foot.\nFor the first time, Urbanation also began tracking new, purpose-built rental units starting to trickle into the GTA market from eight projects, totalling 14 buildings, now under construction and set for completion by next year. They will represent a total of 2,458 new units built specifically as rental, rather than ownership, units.\nAnother 37 buildings with 9,207 units are currently proposed for the GTA.\nWhile rents are comparable between the new purpose-built apartments ($2.38 per square foot) and rental condos ($2.37 per square foot), the unit sizes are considerably different. That, along with security of tenure in apartments, could make apartments a bigger draw over time.\nThe new rental units are averaging 800 square feet, compared to 756 square feet for new condos, says Urbanation.",
        "In an interview broadcast on Saturday, President Donald Trump\u2019s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, ripped into top FBI and Department of Justice officials for launching the Russia probe, The Hill reports.\nGiuliani went on Fox News to discuss the origins of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination between Trump campaign officials and the Kremlin. The former mayor of New York City told host Jeanine Pirro that evidence of criminality will be uncovered at some point, suggesting that former top FBI and DOJ officials were sabotaging President Trump.\n\u201cSomebody made this up, Jeanine. Somebody conceived this. And they superimposed it, and they went out and tried to prove it. And we have to find out: Who\u2019s the brains behind this? Couple of, four or five possibilities. I think we\u2019ll find them,\u201d the lawyer continued.\nLater on in the interview Giuliani clarified his remarks, stating that he is not accusing FBI and DOJ field agents of corruption and bias \u2014 they were only serving their country, according to Trump\u2019s attorney \u2014 but top officials who, Giuliani suggested, launched the Russia probe in order to damage his most prominent client.\nIt comes as no surprise that Rudy Giuliani is suggesting that top FBI and DOJ officials need to be investigated; this appears to be the strategy of the Republican Party. As previously reported by The Inquisitr, many congressional Republicans have publicly suggested that Obama-era officials need to be investigated for launching what the GOP perceives to be a partisan investigation.\nRand Paul, Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton, John Cornyn, and others have openly argued that former Obama officials need to be investigated. Former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey, and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch have all made it on the Republicans\u2019 list. Significantly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled that he is on board with the investigations into potential malfeasance.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his Russia probe last week, submitting the final report to Attorney General William Barr. Barr subsequently released his own memo, in which he quotes Robert Mueller stating that no conspiracy or coordination between Moscow and the Trump campaign has been found. Barr is expected to release the full report by mid-April.",
        "Technically Incorrect: It seems some people can't wait to return the iPhones and, um, Blackberrys and other thoughtful gifts. Thirty percent of millennials say they want stores to open on Christmas.\nWell, here in America shopping is. And I now have some data to prop up this assertion.\nI have before me a survey in which Americans were asked some questions about their shopping lives. Among the questions was, \"What would you do if retailers opened for business at 6 p.m. Christmas evening?\"\nYou might imagine that some Americans would deem this such sacrilege that they'd storm the streets, protest at their local city halls and boycott their local malls for at least 24 hours.\nO come, all ye faithful.\nIn the survey, however, 18 percent said they'd happily rush off to the store to, among other things, return the thoughtful gifts they'd received. Because, one imagines, Christmas just isn't Christmas without being able to have exactly what you want on Christmas Day.\nShould you find this finding startling, or even disgraceful, please consider that in this very same survey 30 percent of millennials declared they'd certainly rush to the stores.\nThe research was performed online in November. LoyaltyOne Consulting, a company that says it specializes \"in assessing, designing and implementing analytics-driven loyalty and customer experience strategies,\" surveyed 1,267 people from the ages of 18-65.\nThere's nothing like analytics-driven loyalty. This once used to be referred to as \"marriage.\"\nPerhaps there wouldn't be the same bellicose frenzy on Christmas evening as there is on Thanksgiving evening, where an eye for an iPhone and a tooth for a PS4 is regularly practiced.\nDoes the latest 'Star Wars' trailer reveal too much?\nBut if Americans can't shut down their retail habits for just one day, what hope is there?\nIn any case, there's ample evidence that even on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, online shopping finally showed its supremacy over the far sweatier pursuit of trawling around malls.\nStill, the one difficulty of online shopping on Christmas Day is that you can't immediately replace that ghastly gift that Uncle Harry was so sure you'd love.\nThere again, imagine the additional pain if you did go to the store on Christmas and the store had run out of the very thing you wanted.\nThe frustration would ruin your Christmas, wouldn't it?",
        "Jan. 5, 2017, 11 a.m.\nBox V2 scans for weak passwords and prevents you from accidentally submitting personal data on fake sites.\nLAS VEGAS\u2014Bitdefender has updated its network security gadget, now known as New Bitdefender Box or Box Version 2, which is designed to protect home networks and Internet of Things devices from outside attack.\nThe original Bitdefender Box extended security protection to devices that could not run antivirus software themselves, specifically IoT devices. By moving security protection to the network level, Box products protect all the devices on the network, including fridges, game consoles, and security cameras.\nWith V2, the Bitdefender Box gets a makeover; the slim, white Apple TV-esque box has been swapped for a tall and conical gadget reminiscent of the Asus Google OnHub router, but with panels of clean, white plastic accented with black strips. A blue LED beneath one of the plastic panels displays the status, similar to the color-changing effect on the Google Home.\nThe original Bitdefender Box includes the company's malware protection, which PCMag has reviewed favorably in the past. A URL blacklist also protects against malicious websites, and a vulnerability assessment can ferret out poorly configured devices on your network. The original Box also has device management tools, letting you see all the devices on your network and set policies for them. A unique feature of Box is Private Line, a VPN-like service that allows users to connect to their network remotely.\nThe new Box V2 includes all of these features, plus an enhanced assessment tool that scans for weak or default passwords and other vulnerabilities hackers could exploit. The new Box also leverages heuristic data gathered by Bitdefender about what safe and normal network traffic looks like. Should it detect anything untoward\u2014exploits, brute-force attacks, port scanning\u2014the Box blocks access.\nBox V2 can also monitor where you enter personal information\u2014such as address, Social Security number, etc.\u2014and prevent you from accidentally submitting that data on fraudulent or insecure websites.\nBox V2 will have far more capable hardware than the original under the hood. Bitdefender says the new device will sport a dual-core ARM Cortex A9 processor and 1GB of DDR3 memory as well as 4GB of eMMC/NAND storage. The beefier hardware is designed to run more activities locally, from the Box V.2 itself.\nWhen Bitdefender unveiled the first Box unit, the company made it clear that it was meant to function in tandem with, not replace, users' home routers. Bitdefender says this is still the case, but the Box V2 has improved wireless hardware. The device supports Dual Concurrent 2.4GHz and 5GHz, 802.11n MIMO 2x2 + 802.11ac MIMO 33 AC1300. There are also two 10/100/1000 BaseT Ethernet ports on the device.\nThe Box Version 2 is expected to retail in the sub-$200 range, and will go on sale later this year with pre-orders beginning in summer 2017. Bitdefender says it will likely keep both devices on the market to provide different price points. Either device comes with a free year of security coverage from Bitdefender, which will cost consumers $99 a year afterwards.\nBoth Box devices are now part of Bitdefender Total Security and provide consumers with unlimited licenses to install the company's software on other devices.",
        "The Learning Network | What Have You Learned Playing Video Games?\nWhat Have You Learned Playing Video Games?\nWhat are your favorite video games? What do you think they have taught you?\nDo you think video games can help inspire social change? Have you ever played one that helped you understand a serious global problem?\nThis year, a United Nations program devoted to urban planning in countries affected by poverty or natural disasters began developing a sports field in the slums of Kibera, Kenya, designing it in the popular sandbox video game Minecraft. The game, which allows players to build entire worlds out of cubes in a 3-D environment, helped the project leaders create a visual representation of the field that could be easily understood by the neighborhood\u2019s residents.\nThe project, known as Block by Block, is among the highlights this week at the Games for Change Festival in New York, an annual event that promotes video games that seek social change. These efforts \u2014 known as serious games \u2014 once focused on education, to entice students to learn through digital play. But attention has shifted to more ambitious efforts like Block by Block, and a large part of that push has come from Games for Change, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that has worked with Google, NASA, the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation and TEDx.\nOne speaker at this year\u2019s festival is Zoran Popovic, the director of the Center for Game Science at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He led the team of researchers responsible for the puzzle game Foldit, which sought to crowdsource a solution to a scientific problem. Foldit asked players to take on the role of a biochemist and map out how proteins might be folded in nature. The game provided scores based on how well they performed. Three papers in the journal Nature have been published, based on Foldit discoveries, since the game\u2019s release in 2008; the most famous, in 2011, explained how Foldit players had helped to decipher the structure of an AIDS-related enzyme, a problem that scientists had been trying to solve for years.\nMr. Popovic plans to unveil a new project this week, a synthetic-biology game called NanoCrafter, whose goal is to discover molecular structures that could benefit vaccine and cancer research.\n\u2014 What are your favorite video games? What games did you play when you were younger? Looking back, what do you think they taught you \u2014 whether physical or mental skills or something more intangible? How have they enriched your life?\n\u2014 Have you ever played a video game like the ones at Games for Change, in which the goal is \u201cmore than entertainment\u201d? What did you think of it? What did you learn?\n\u2014 Do you think video games can be effective tools for learning? Do you think playing them might actually help \u201cchange the world\u201d? Why or why not?\n\u2014 If your school were to invest in a \u201cvideo game for change\u201d that was, like the examples in this article, fun to play, intellectually enriching and altruistically focused, what would you like it to be about? How might it work?\nHonestly I have never really played video games before, well I have but not as much as an average teen. But that little that I did play I just learned little strategies and the games really made you think. But they are really not that productive.\nI used to play games a lot but i have slowed down playing them now. I actually have learnt a lot of things from certain video games like strategies, and my friend said that he learnt that rubber comes from trees.\nI think integrating games into school could be a good idea. It would probably be executed poorly in most areas though. There\u2019s a stigma against video games in general that label all games as bad for your brain and they make you do bad things.\nMy favorite video game has to be guitar hero. I think this game has taught me how to multitask with my hands. I think video games are very good and can help inspire social change, depending on the type of game. No, I have never played a video game that has helped inspire me to change a serious global problem.\nI don\u2019t like to play video games. I rather do something else than be in four hours play games that not be educated.\nthe video games i have played are strategic and would make me think. i have never played a video game that benefits a cause before so i would go with some of the concepts listed in the article when deciding on one for my school to invest in.\nThat\u2019s actually really interesting concept because most games are like what you guys said, fps and the like. there are a handful of games that are different or promote learning. i personally have not heard anything that could help with research.\nMy favorite video games are the grand theft auto video games. Not just because of the violence but also because I don\u2019t play very many video games and it\u2019s fun to just drive around and wander the game. When I was younger my favorite video game was a hand held analog stick with a few different games on it including PAC man. I don\u2019t believe that playing these types of video games benefits you much. I\u2019ve never played a more than entertainment goal game. But I think it\u2019s a very intriguing idea, especially scenes so many kids learn from their surroundings and technology now days.\nMy favorite video games are Minecraft, COD, Counterstrike Source, Guitar Hero, Farcry, and Rainbow six. Looking back at these games I have learned a little more about weaponry, and playing video games has also helped with my hand-eye corrdination. I also think playing video games can help increase your reflexes and response time. When I started playing Minecraft I immediately fell In love because it allowed me to use my creativity and build things that I\u2019ve always wanted to build. I think video games can be a very effective tool for learning because it makes learning fun. But I also think that it should be taken in moderation and staring a screen all day isn\u2019t that great for you and neither is sitting all day. The more interactive learning is the better it will be in general. I think that bringing video games into schools could be a good way to bring more interaction to learning.\nMy number one game is World of tanks. when i was younger, i played minecraft. I was a 4 year minecraft player.. Minecraft gave me inspiration. But when i got World of tanks, i quit minecraft. World of tanks has taught me alot. Ive learned alot since i started playing. No blood, no gore. Just fun with big metal machines.\nI don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t play video games.\nWell i have not learned a lot because i don\u2019t play a lot. It shows that there is violence in the world. Also how to help you shoot more acculturate. I think that if schools had games then more people could enjoy and relax more.\nI have played some games that teaches you life lessons and some games that inspires you. Video games nowadays have little education to offer for you if you are playing modern consoles.\nThe way i learned to play video games is that most people can easily play any game if they put their mind into it. i play video games every single day and beat every single game there is its just what i like to do everyday when i get home from school etc. i can play really hard games that not everyone can beat i\u2019m technically the best at playing horror games and war games plus games like assasins creed 1 to throughout all the other assasin creed games. i am such a video game expert i\u2019ve played every system that ever came out from the beginning of atari to all of todays games. i just love to play video games.\nI love playing video games with my brothers. I play Black Ops, Mine Craft, Kinect Sports and more. Playing these games explain more than moving your thumbs it showed you how to multitask and some of the video games keeps you physically active when you have a X-Box 360.\nIm a senior in High School. Im always playing video games whenever im not either at school, work, or golf. I love video games and I feel that they are a quintessential part of learning. I have played almost every game. Games like pokemon help you to solve problems. Games like portal cause you to use physics and puzzles to play the game. Games like the bioshock series or the half life series create stories, that in my opinion, are better than reading book because you get to experience it. Even games like Call of duty increases reflexes.\n\u2013 My favourite video games are Deus Ex, The Witcher 2 and Half-Life 2.\nAs someone who lives in germany, where most students don\u2019t speak english very good. I think video games taught me a lot about english. It was the only subject I NEVER had problems with. From the first day on I was too good for my grade.\n\u2013 I honestly have never played one of those games, but after this article I\u2019m definitely looking forward to them.\n\u2013 I don\u2019t know, maybe about subjects, that are boring and complicated for many students, like biology and chemistry? I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to come up with an idea, but smart people, probably would.\nI play a lot of RPGs mostly. They are some of my favorite games. Most RPGs give you choices, and what choices you make affects the people, and world around you. Usually the choices range from good, to neutral, to evil. This is very similar to how life really is. The choices we make, whether they are good or bad, have a bigger impact on the world around us than we may think.\nmy favorite video games are games like Portal and Persona, games that actually require thinking while playing and not just mindless button mashing, the thing i think they\u2019ve taught me\u2026 that no matter who you are you can always be a hero if you put your mind to it!\nUnfortunately not, i would love to have the chance to be able to though, i believe that video games are more than just a way to distract ourselves or have a good time, i believe that the educational value of video games are much greater than what people believe.\nYes, video games are tools, whether the tool is used for entertainment or for education, it\u2019s full potential cannot be realized unless someone steps forward and says \u201clets try to use it like this!\u201d and works hard on that.\nI would like that many possibilities for interactive learning would open up, these interactive lessons would not only increase the amount of fun in a classroom, but also the amount of passion from students who can honestly say that the lessons spoke to them.\n@Alondra The correct sentence would be: I don\u2019t like to play video games. I Would rather do something else than playing four hours of video games that do not help with my education.\nI have played video games for years. All to often my choices were challenged or denied by my parents. At first I couldn\u2019t comprehend the difference or what were the deciding factors for their answer. As I\u2019ve grown older I see know how video games have the power to shape one\u2019s personality. Even in video games there are choices to be made, altruistic choices that can benefit another individual in the game or choices to eliminate your opponent. The choices are made in real life all to often and it\u2019s vital that children and teenagers recognized the value or consequences of the choices even within the games.\nI am impressed by the idea of Games for Change. If our school were to invest in such a game perhaps one that affords students the opportunity to understand how closely connected their games choices are to real life. A game that teaches altruistic behavior and choices while still having fun. We find a significant change and positive growth in our society through future generations.\nThe focus of the some games is to build what ever the mind can imagine. I think that games can be more than entertainment because it makes you think about things that you may have see in your life. It also could make you think of real building and structure around the world. Others games can make you think about real life world problems and make you aware that they are happening. They may also help influence what you do later in your life. Overall I think that some games can do more than just entertainment and can make you think about real things and ideas.",
        "Why is Amazon spending nearly $14 billion for Whole Foods ? One reason: People who buy yoga mats and fitness trackers on Amazon might also like grapes, nuts and other healthy items at the organic grocery chain.\nIn short, the deal stands to net Amazon a wealth of data-driven insights into how shoppers behave offline \u2014 insights that are potentially very lucrative.\nTo be sure, there are plenty of other benefits to the combination. Amazon will derive steady revenue from more than 460 Whole Foods stores; it can also introduce robots and other automation technologies to cut costs and improve the bottom line. But ultimately, Amazon wants to sell even more goods and services to both online and offline shoppers \u2014 including stuff they might not even realize they need.\nAmazon has been quiet on its specific plans so far, but analysts are enthusiastic about the possibilities. \"This will be a fun time for Amazon,\" said Ryne Misso of the Market Track retail research firm in Chicago. \"They are introducing a whole new set of shopper profiles that span grocery stores and durables.\"\nAmazon is a pro at using data on past shopping and browsing to prod you to buy more. The home page, for instance, offers quick access to recently viewed items and suggests products \"inspired by your shopping trends.\" Amazon sends emails about price cuts on items you&apos;ve searched for but haven&apos;t bought \u2014 yet.\nBrian Handly, CEO of the mobile analytics firm Reveal Mobile in Raleigh, North Carolina, said that while Amazon doesn&apos;t necessarily have better artificial-intelligence capabilities than its rivals, it has scale in the number of shoppers and variety of businesses it has.\nWhole Foods can help by giving Amazon a better understanding of what people do at physical retail stores, where 90 percent of worldwide retail spending still happens, according to eMarketer.\nAmazon could learn whether a particular customer tends to come once a month to stock up, or make smaller and shorter visits more frequently. Wi-Fi hotspots in stores might collect unique signals emanating from smartphones to figure out which aisles customers spend the most time in. Same with sensors on product shelves, something Amazon is currently testing at a convenience store in Seattle.\n\"They will break that data down to build stories about their consumers,\" Misso said.\nAll this might feel creepy, but it&apos;s something Amazon already does and does well online. Larry Ponemon, who runs the Ponemon Institute privacy think tank, said he personally would find tracking of his self-described unhealthy eating habits \"very creepy.\" But he doesn&apos;t expect any consumer backlash because Amazon and Whole Foods have both earned a high level of trust and loyalty.\nTo make stores more profitable, Amazon could push customers to order lower-profit bulk items such as detergent and toilet paper over the internet. That would free up store space for higher-profit items, such as perishables and ready-to-heat prepared meals.\nAmazon&apos;s challenge will be to \"separate the profitable businesses that can be better done online and the profitable businesses that can be better done at retail,\" said Larry Light, CEO of the brand consulting firm Arcature in Delray Beach, Florida.\nAmazon might find that some items sell better at some locations than others. It can stock just the most popular items at each location; other items are just a click away for home delivery. It&apos;s an approach Amazon is already taking at its eight physical bookstores.\nHandly said that even if Amazon can&apos;t get rid of every lower-profit item on shelves, it can use data to figure out ways to drive more customers to those aisles.\nAmazon will be able to use grocery data to drive other purchases as well. Say you buy a lot of ingredients typically found in Asian recipes. Amazon might then suggest a Thai or Japanese cookbook. It might also recommend a new rice cooker.\nIt works the other way, too. If you just watched a Mexican food show on Amazon video, Amazon might point you to deals on avocados and perhaps offer subscriptions for regular deliveries of tortillas and canned beans. Or it might automate a grocery shopping list based on a chosen recipe on your Kindle e-reader.\nJust bought some camping equipment? Amazon might offer granola bars and other ready-to-eat meals for your hikes. Likewise, someone who just bought a fitness tracker might be in the market for more produce.\nWalmart remains the leading retailer overall and has its own huge stake in groceries; its retail revenue is more than three times that of Amazon, even with Whole Foods included. Yet it&apos;s on the defensive. To beef up its online operations, Walmart has gone on a spending spree for e-commerce companies such as Jet, Bonobos, ModCloth and Moosejaw. Analysts say these companies should help Walmart get into the data game as well.\n\"The real challenge of Walmart is they recognize that technology can be bought and technical expertise can be bought,\" Light said.\nBut playing catch-up is \"harder than just building it into your company as a core part of the company&apos;s DNA,\" said Brent Franson, CEO of Euclid Analytics, a San Francisco company looking to bring data analysis to physical stores. \"Amazon has the benefit from Day One of architecting a business that is data-driven, out of the gate.\"",
        "The more I read about blockchain and the more I talk to the CIOs, CTOs, developers, and tech-savvy executives I call early adopters, the clearer it is that everyone will need to make sense of blockchain for their organization.\nIn the biggest sense, blockchain is a proxy for the genuine excitement about applications and platforms that cross company boundaries and support vast ecosystems. Let\u2019s call these collaborative ecosystem applications platforms. Marshall Van Alstyne explained the logic of these platforms in his book Platform Revolution. We should all be excited about such applications.\nIn a technological sense, blockchain is key for creating an unalterable, trusted record of certain types of transactions. But the problem is that blockchain tech isn\u2019t really needed for all collaborative ecosystem applications.\nSo, how can each of us figure out what blockchain really means to us? When is the excitement about blockchain about a collaborative ecosystem application that does not in actuality need blockchain? When do such apps really require blockchain? How can existing enterprise data feed blockchain applications and vice versa?\nAs a start of this series of articles, I am going to focus on how Syncsort is answering these questions. Syncsort is a company that focuses on building the infrastructure to support the modern data supply chain. With products for data integration, data quality, capacity management, mainframe optimization, high availability and security, Syncsort is dedicated to the general proposition of its tagline: Advancing Data. On my podcast, I recently spoke with Syncsort\u2019s CEO Josh Rogers and CTO Dr. Tend\u00fc Yo\u011furt\u00e7u. The way they are making sense of blockchain provides important lessons.\nSyncsort has identified four megatrends that they are paying especially close attention to and ensuring that their business strategy aligns with. Those are the cloud, streaming data and IoT, data science (which includes machine learning and AI), and data governance. Yo\u011furt\u00e7u told me that Syncsort views blockchain, in many ways, as falling under the data governance mantle and that as a result, the company is focusing on early research and product development to support the growing adoption and expansion of blockchain usage.\nBoth Rogers and Yo\u011furt\u00e7u see the greatest benefits from blockchain in applications where manual confirmation or cross-border parties are involved, or where automatic tracking and validation visible to all parties is desired. Blockchain helps to eliminate the middleman in many transactions and improves security by validating the authenticity of products and components and reducing counterfeiting. But blockchain-ready applications and tools are nascent and they must mature for blockchain to be widely adopted.\nBut Syncsort is preparing for this growing adoption because blockchain has applicability in so many sectors, especially those with supply chains, from food to car manufacturing, to cross-border trade. Blockchain can reduce the complexity of tracking these chains and simplify and solidify contractual arrangements between companies.\nIn addition, Syncsort is very focused on software for the fast-growing Big Iron to Big Data market, driven by the need for data-driven organizations to quickly extract value from critical data across their enterprise, often moving this data from traditional data systems like IBM mainframes and midrange systems and then seamlessly integrating it into a growing number of next-generation analytical platforms. The ability to access and integrate traditional and blockchain data for analysis will be part of this equation.\nGiven this context of what blockchain can do best, it\u2019s worth returning to the original question of when using blockchain makes the most sense. Rogers told me that part of the difficulty of answering the question is that blockchain technology is still in such early stages.\nRogers added that Syncsort will be engaging in partnerships in the blockchain space that will enable the business to add value and begin to understand the key integration points of working with blockchain.\nYo\u011furt\u00e7u also cautioned that blockchain isn\u2019t completely enterprise-ready yet. She mentioned that to run transactions on blockchain, data will need to be integrated into an existing transactional infrastructure, which requires a new set of tools and utilities to support that integration. Therefore, Syncsort is focused on creating a data pipeline that extracts useful data out of the blockchain platform and delivers it wherever it\u2019s needed.\nBut if Syncsort and other companies can figure out these data movement questions, the power of blockchain could be more fully leveraged. Then the use cases I mentioned earlier become highly pertinent and businesses can adopt blockchain applications to deal with complex logistics or supply chain issues.\nFor their part, Syncsort is preparing for the expansion by investing in technology to move data in and out of blockchain. Yo\u011furt\u00e7u said she believes the company is in the best position to manage this data migration because of their existing expertise moving data in and out of mainframe, Hadoop, cloud and on premise data stores as well as streaming distributed platforms.\nWhen data is brought into blockchain, the platform will likely have the same challenges as other platforms in ensuring that once data is in the data lake or warehouse, it can then be extracted for use by applications. And this will lead to data quality, synchronization, and integration problems, and these will need to be supported by a product like Syncsort.\nYo\u011furt\u00e7u also said Syncsort intends to increase the number of security products in the company\u2019s portfolio that can leverage blockchain. As part of this, Syncsort will be partnering with the Hyperledger project.\nIt\u2019s too early to know the complete shape of the blockchain universe and how companies will use it in the future. But as the technology continues to gain traction, it\u2019s worth analyzing the most promising use cases as well as how businesses like Syncsort are responding as a way to predict what happens next.",
        "Merck has been taking heat for the price it paid for Idenix -- Here's why it actually isn't as crazy as it sounds.\nRecently, the pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK) has been receiving a bit of heat from commentators who believe that the company offered way too much money for the hepatitis c therapeutics developer Idenix Pharmaceuticals (UNKNOWN:IDIX.DL) last week. Although the $3.85 billion acquisition gives Merck full rights to a promising mid-stage hepatitis c drug called samatasvir, many people believe that Gilead's (NASDAQ:GILD) blockbuster hep c drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) may deplete most of the market by the time Merck's combo (including samatasvir) can apply for FDA approval.\nIf we are limiting our discussion to the US hep c patient population, I would fully agree that Merck made an unfavorable bet with its bid for Idenix. However, many people seem to miss the fact that the US only has about 2% of the world's hep c patients. Even if Gilead utterly dominates the US market for hep c in the next 3-4 years, Merck can target well over 100 million non-US patients who have few (if any) options for elimination of the virus.\nOutside the US, Merck wouldn't be able to match the prices that Gilead currently charges for a 12-week regimen of Sovaldi in the United States ($84,000). However, Merck could later decide to partner with local distributors who would commercialize Merck's drug in exchange for tiered royalty payments. These are often structured as percentage-based payments that offer passive income to the parent company based on the drug's performance.\nAlthough the income would take much longer to materialize, it would come at little to no cost to Merck (aside from the developmental and acquisition expenses it is already incurring). This would make it commercially viable for Merck to target the huge hep c populations in developing countries without issues of scalability or large, upfront investments.\nI think Merck realizes that it cannot launch a hep c drug that will take off sprinting like Sovaldi did (with $2.3 billion sold in its first full quarter on the market), but there are many dollars waiting to be picked up by reasonably priced hep c products that work better than generic antivirals. On the global scale, hepatitis c is a numbers game that cannot be won by overpriced drugs. Even if Gilead's Sovaldi fully saturates US market by the time Merck launches a competitor, it only means that the low-hanging fruit are gone.\nIt's also worth noting that Gilead's Sovaldi would not always erase market share for other hep c therapies. Because antiviral therapies often have synergistic effects, we could eventually see Sovaldi and Merck's drugs used in combination (and in fact, Merck is already testing a three-drug combo including Sovaldi in the hope of finding a faster-acting cure for hepatitis c). Drug layering is a growing trend in medicine, and it gives latecomer cocktails like Merck's a fighting chance against drugs that have already saturated the market years after launch.\nHaving said this, it should be stated that the Idenix acquisition was an aggressive move that could easily end up backfiring should a cocktail including samatasvir be drastically inferior to Sovaldi. An FDA rejection of samatasvir could also kill Merck's multibillion-dollar investment outright, depending on the company's ability to salvage the product in such a scenario.\nUnless a successful drug combination trial is performed, Merck's cocktail would also have to compete directly with AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) experimental hep c therapy, which received priority review from the FDA yesterday. FDA approval of this product is seems likely, which puts more pressure on Merck to focus on ex-US markets.\nGilead spent a lot more for Sovaldi (through the $11 billion acquisition of Pharmasset in 2011), but the company is on track to make its money back pretty quickly. Although the Merck acquisition of Idenix is smaller in size, it is riskier and much less \"efficient\" in terms of its ability to break even. Assuming the Sovaldi run rate continues, the Pharmasset acquisition will have paid for itself by some time in 2015. The Idenix acquisition, on the other hand, may not pay for itself for quite some time -- and that assumes regulatory approval.\nAlthough Merck has the ability to fund new R&D projects, its larger corporate structure means the company isn't as nimble as smaller biotechs. Outright acquisitions are simpler, and more cost effective in most cases. Why would Merck want to develop its own drugs when it can acquire phase 2/3 drugs that already come with built-in research teams?\nAs of Q1 2014, Merck reported over $15.8 billion in cash on its balance sheets. Merck could be using this money to pay off the $8.5 billion in long term debts reported on the balance sheet, but a low interest rate environment make this an unattractive option for corporations without any solvency issues.\nMerck may have overpaid for Idenix, but I do believe that aggressive acquisitions still make a lot of sense for this company given its situation. Merck has recently been focusing much of its R&D efforts on the mid-stage PD-1 inhibiting cancer drug pembrolizumab, which has shown phenomenal efficacy against difficult forms of cancer (late-stage skin, liver, renal, etc.). We won't know for a while whether the hep c play has paid off -- but this is a big market with lots of opportunities.\nShrewd biotech investor, research consultant, numbers guy.",
        "A look at players from Chandler and Gilbert Perry who might make it big in college football after their high school careers.\nThere are quite a few potential future college football players to watch in the Week 7 Game of the Week.\nThe game pits two-time defending 6A champion Chandler and state runner-up, Gilbert Perry, on Friday night.\nJacob Conover, QB, 6-1, 205, Sr.\nArizona State, under new coach Herm Edwards, made a great run on Conover, who has committed to BYU. But before he begins college, he plans to go on a two-year church mission after he finishes his high school academic requirements in December. If he wasn't in the same class as Pinnacle's Spencer Rattler, he would be the No. 1 quarterback in Arizona. Conover has great poise and intelligence, finds open receivers, never solely locking into his first option. It is why Chandler has won so many games under his leadership. The bigger the game, the better he plays.\nDeCarlos Brooks, RB, 5-11, 195, Sr.\nCommitted to California. Brooks has run for more than 2,100 yards in his varsity career. He has 526 yards and eight TDs on 82 carries this season. He had one of his better games last week in a win against Mesa Desert Ridge, running for 137 yards and two TDs on 15 carries against a good defense.\nBrayden Liebrock, TE, 6-5, 225, Sr.\nCommitted to Texas. Teams have been keying on him this season with lots of double teams. He has 19 catches for 172 yards. He is too good an athlete to be held in check.\nMatthew Pola-Mao, DT, 6-1, 310, Sr.\nThis will be Pola-Mao's first game this season, after being ineligible the first five games because of the Arizona Interscholastic Association transfer rule. Early in 2018, Pola-Mao listed Michigan, Oregon, Utah, USC, Washington and Tennessee among his favorites. Pola-Mao gives the Chandler defensive front an extra push.\nGunner Maldonado, Athlete, 6-0, 185, Jr.\nHe might be the best athlete on the team. Earlier in the season, coach Shaun Aguano added receiving duties to Maldonado's game, making the offense more dynamic and giving Conover a big-play threat. He projects to be a safety in college. But he can also return kicks. He is a threat everywhere on the field and major colleges will be in hot pursuit of him over the next year.\nWorth watching: FS Avery Carrington, 6-2, 195, senior, committed to Nevada. ... LB Zach Bowers, 6-0, 215, senior, great motor, has committed to Hawaii. One of the state's best inside linebackers. ... OL Josh Pena, 6-1, 290, senior, anchor of the line. Missed a few games with injury but he's back. ... OLB/DE Max Sandlin, 6-3, 220, senior, is committed to Navy.\nBrayden Rohme, OT, 6-7, 275, Sr.\nHe is azcentral sports' top-ranked offensive lineman this season. He committed to California. Anchors a talented line that is making junior QB Chubba Purdy's job easier and opening huge holes for RB Jalen Young, who ran for a school-record 338 yards last week.\nChubba Purdy, QB, 6-2, 196, Jr.\nHe may never catch his prolific older brother's passing records but he could see more college coaches than Brock ever saw. Chubba is a little taller than Brock and possesses a great arm and can run. His recruiting will continue to ramp up.\nKyle Patterson, TE, 6-6, 230, Sr.\nSon of former Tempe McClintock, Arizona State and Green Bay Packers defensive tackle Shawn Patterson. Great athlete who is being recruited in both football and basketball.\nWorth watching: RB Jalen Young, 5-10, 195, senior, is starting to really take off. Another game like last week and major college coaches can't ignore him. ... SS Adrei Mayberry, 6-1, 205, junior, great ball skills, a beast at center field. ... WR Colby Dickie, 5-9, 185, senior, very underrated receiver who has all the skills to make it in college. ... WR D'Shayne James, senior, committed last year to Iowa State but won't play this season because of a preseason knee injury that required surgery.",
        "SPOILER ALERT: Before you read this post, roast yourself a nice pig, pour yourself a bottle of wine (I suggest a fruity grenache with the pork), cork the bottle extremely tightly and watch last night\u2019s Lost.\nWe can spend all day talking about the mythology and background revealed on \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d an intense episode of Lost\u2013and I\u2019m sure we will\u2013but let\u2019s say this first: fancy story aside, last night showed us a fine hour of acting, plain and simple.\nI\u2019ve seen Nestor Carbonell in a variety of roles on TV (from Bat Manuel in The Tick to the CBS soap Cane), and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been a slouch as Richard on Lost. But until this season, he\u2019s had to play Richard on a single, subdued, sustained note of enigmatic cool. In \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d he almost literally made Richard into another character, showing us the decent, desperate, heartbroken man who would be transformed over 140 years as Jacob\u2019s ambassador on the Island.\nIt may have seemed like a lot of time spent to some viewers, but clearly Cuse and Lindelof thought they needed to show, not just tell, the circumstances that brought Richard to his current pass. And Carbonell sold it, embodied Ricardo\u2019s horror as he lived through a Victorian-horror melodrama. Which is important, because they had to place us in the mindset of someone who believes, literally not figuratively, that he is actually in hell.\nSo are they in hell? (That, and Purgatory, were among the first theories fans spun about Lost.) Are they actually in danger, as Ghost Isabella says, of going to hell? No, but Ricardo has come to what he thinks of as hell, and to a place that someone of his era and mindset will naturally interpret as hell. Unlike, say, Hurley, a religious, penitent man living on the Canary Islands in 1867 has not read sci-fi or seen a monster movie in his life. If he ends up in a place where he sees horrors, where the dead come to life (and are seemingly killed again), and a thing made of smoke snatches men up to their death\u2014well, that\u2019s hell, case closed. Someone of another era will give it a different name.\nIt\u2019s not hell\u2013right?\u2013but it is, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d told us more explicitly than ever, a metaphysical playing ground, where two forces are battling it out through human subjects, not unlike gods in Greek mythology. So what game are Jacob and Smokey/The Man in Black playing? We got the rough outline at the end of season 5\u2013and fans have inferred or theorized most of the rest\u2013but it was still a bit stunning to hear Jacob say it to Ricardo directly.\nTo wit: Smokey is imprisoned on the Island. He is a malevolent force\u2013call him evil, call him hatred, call him the devil if you want\u2013who, if released, would spread over the world like, well, black smoke. (Or wine. I like the idea of a Wine Monster.) Jacob brings people to the Island, where\u2013whatever they have done in the past\u2013they have a chance to choose good over evil. (He is, metaphorically, the producer of Lost.) Jacob believes people can choose good. Smokey believes (as he said in the season 5 finale) that they always go bad in the end. Smokey tries to manipulate and tempt them toward that end; Jacob believes they must choose of their own free will.\nSo far, so God-and-Devily. But what is \u201cright and wrong\u201d in the endgame of Lost, anyway? I\u2019m glad, if this is the case, that the arc of the series is the characters\u2019 redemption, and that they have agency to choose for themselves. Still, is their goodness going to be defined by which side they pick in this Island-god showdown? Why exactly, is it \u201cgood\u201d to pick the jackass deity who strands innocent people in an Island hellhole over the jackass deity who deceives and or kills them once they get there? It\u2019s better, maybe, but I\u2019m not sure Jacob\u2019s role in all this seems so holy. You crashed me on this terrifying rock so you could \u201cprove [Smokey] wrong?\u201d Have a freaking debate society and leave me out of it!\nIn any event, from \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d the notion of the Losties finally saying pox-on-both-your-houses and rejecting the whole cosmic game seems less likely. Though I still see signs that Smokey and Jacob may be more alike than they let on: it was certainly interesting to see that, when Smokey tried to enlist Ricardo to kill Jacob, he gave him the knife and the same speech that Dogen (not Jacob, but his servant) gave Sayid to get him to kill Smokey.\nAs all this unfolds, I hope that the other conflicts over the Island built over the last five seasons\u2013the \u201cscience-based\u201d story, if you will\u2013aren\u2019t wholly subsumed in the Paradise Lost scenario. How does Hanso, and his descendants in the Hanso foundation, figure into all this? Why did they come to see the Island as significant, and what exactly did Dharma want to achieve on the Island? How did Widmore get there in the first place, and what did he want\u2013and what investment, if any, do Smokey and Jacob have in his war with Ben, and vice versa? The closer I get to the center of the onion, the more I want to revisit the layers.\nThose are all big-picture questions that (I will be a broken record here) are impossible to judge until the season and series are over. As an episode, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d again proved Lost\u2019s ability to find the humanity in, and build a connection with, its most seemingly enigmatic characters. Hell of a job.\n* Is it just me, or did Titus Welliver get direction to deliver his lines like Terry O\u2019Quinn\u2014or, specifically, as O\u2019Quinn-as-Smokey-as-Locke? Whether intentional or coincidental, Welliver\u2019s phrasing and manner made clear he and O\u2019Quinn were playing the same character in different bodies. Nice work.\n* So if Smokey gets off The Island, the world will become plagued with evil, hatred and malevolence. As opposed to\u2026?\n* And about Jacob: did he strike anyone else in the 1867 part of this story as more tough and hard-assed than we\u2019ve seen him in the Island\u2019s present? A bit of an Old Testament Jacob?\n* I\u2019ve been reading elsewhere about the parallels between the plot on the Island and Stephen King\u2019s novels, especially The Stand, which at this point I am glad I haven\u2019t read. But when the Man in Black took out the magic weapon and told Ricardo to kill his enemy, was I the only one reminded of HBO\u2019s Carniv\u00e0le, and the murderous eternal war among the avatars?\n* When Ricardo saw Isabella in the hold of The Black Rock, the inference was that this was actually Smokey appearing as Isabella to manipulate him. Presumably Smokey had access to Ricardo\u2019s memories after examining and flash-photographing him, yes? I could look this up but I\u2019m not going to: is this the first time we\u2019ve seen Smokey manifest as a person who (unlike Locke, Yemi or Christian) had not physically been on the Island, even as a corpse?\n* That CGI butterfly that fluttered into the Black Rock\u2019s hold\u2013I assume it\u2019s significant, and I have no explanation for it. (My one theory, that the Island is actually Pandora from Avatar, is probably not too likely.) Speaking of CGI, credit to Lost for showing some scenes set on the ocean that did not look like a low-budget video game.\n* OK, this may be immature, but was anyone else wondering if Hurley and Richard were going to share a kiss, a la Ghost, when Ricardo was visited by the shade of Isabella? It would have blown the moment, I suppose, but still.\n* More seriously, when Isabella told Richard he\u2019d suffered enough, were you thinking he was going to die? More to the point, were you, like me, hoping he would die, as a mercy to him? It\u2019s a tribute to the show that it can cause a reaction like this to a character we\u2019ve long known as one of the bad guys\u2013or so, at least, we thought.",
        "Concepcion\u2014who, it turned out, was a former KB-Metro Manila president\u2014added that he \u201cdeeply regrets the pain\u201d his attendance at the Imee Marcos-led affair had caused.\nConcepcion does appear in need of strong reminding, because even his words of regret are notable more for what they failed to say. There was, to be clear, no apology in the statement, only an attempt to soothe the wounds reopened by the startling sight of the UP president flashing the triumphalist Marcos \u201cV\u201d sign alongside the dictator\u2019s eldest daughter.\nWhat comes off Concepcion\u2019s words, in fact, is a profound unreflectiveness not only about his responsibilities as caretaker of an institution with a hallowed tradition of activism, but, more gravely, about the very national history and memory that many of his old pals in that soir\u00e9e are systematically working to undermine, if not erase altogether.\nWas his early dalliance with the dictatorship\u2019s youth cadre wrong in any respect? Perhaps it was an association he regretted now as a mature, conscientious Filipino\u2014especially after everything that has come to light about the KB and its bloody history?\nSurely, for instance, he is familiar by now with the story of Archimedes Trajano. On Aug. 31, 1977, during one of the KB fora at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, the 21-year-old Mapua student questioned Imee Marcos\u2019 appointment as KB national chair. Witnesses recalled how Trajano was subsequently seized and dragged by the presidential daughter\u2019s bodyguards and how, days later, his body was found on the street with marks of severe torture.\nTrajano\u2019s mother had to wait until after the Marcoses were ousted before she could file charges of \u201cfalse imprisonment, kidnapping, wrongful death, and a deprivation of rights\u201d in a Hawaii court. She later won the damage suit.\nDoes Concepcion regret having been, in any way, part of such an organization? He didn\u2019t say. He expressed regret only for hurting his UP constituency, but not for his membership in what amounted to be the youth brigade of the Marcos dictatorship. Until now, it appears, he sees nothing wrong with the KB.\nThe implication disturbs: Even as the cream of the country\u2019s activist youth was being decimated by the martial law regime, was Concepcion perhaps having the time of his life as part of Imee Marcos\u2019 national posse, such that, decades later, all he can apparently summon of that dark period is his halcyon memories of youthful friendships made in that privileged cocoon?\nIt must be asked of the UP president: Is that dangerous obliviousness still there?",
        "They ever-mystifying Blackhawks power play continues to be a work in progress in the playoffs. Some things never change.\n\u201cFor whatever reason we\u2019ve never really had a top power play,\u2019\u2019 forward Patrick Kane said prior to Game 6 of the Hawks\u2019 first-round series with the Nashville Predators at the United Center. \u201cMaybe in our younger years, our power play seemed to be clicking a little bit more.\nIt almost always is. But despite a slew of world-class offensive talent, the Hawks never have had a world-class power play. Not even coach Joel Quenneville\u2019s renowned tinkering seems to make a significant impact.\nThe hope heading into the playoffs was that Kane\u2019s return would give the power play a boost. It worked in Game 1, when Kane assisted on Patrick Sharp\u2019s 5-on-3 goal in the second period and then fed Jonathan Toews for a standard power-play goal 5:18 later to cap a comeback from a 3-3 deficit in the Hawks\u2019 4-3 double-overtime victory.\nBut since then, the Hawks are 0-for-13 on the power play. They are 0-for-6 at home in the series. Overall, the Hawks are tied for 11th among the 16 playoff teams in power play efficiency (2-of-17, 11.8 percent).\nThe Hawks made some progress in that regard in Game 5, with some power plays in which they controlled the puck and put pressure on the Predators\u2019 penalty kill. But even Quenneville noted the Hawks need more than that at this point.\nThe Hawks have won the Stanley Cup without a stellar power play. But \u2014 eventually perhaps \u2014 this team might need a little more production with the man-advantage to make the difference.\n\u201cIt always seems to come down to special teams,\u201d Kane said. \u201cYou can say [in Game 5], they scored a goal on the power play and they get the [3-1] lead and kind of take off and run with it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good way for your top players to get the puck, feel the puck, make some plays, get some confidence and maybe that can cross over into 5-on-5 play, too.",
        "Unemployment's at a near-record low and job openings are at a near-record high. You know what that means? It's a candidate's market out there! Whether you're a recent graduate looking for a foot in the door or a supply chain veteran hungry for a change of scenery, the power is in your hands. Organizations across Supply Management are beginning to recognize that attracting a stand-out candidate will mean taking pains to make themselves a stand-out organization. Can't-miss opportunities are waiting for those applicants who take the appropriate action.\nA candidate's market doesn't mean applicants can get away with anything. Most of the same old rules still apply and that means the same old words and phrases will land your resume in the wastebasket. Here are a few descriptors that'll make your application stand out for all the wrong reasons.\nI'll never forget the look on my freshman English professor's face when he saw 'utilized' peppered throughout my first paper. Let's just say he wasn't pleased. To be fair, the impulse to utilize 'utilize' is understandable. A word like 'use' can look too basic, too simple to impress a hiring manager. In reality, including this word does little more than add 6 unnecessary letters to your resume. It's important to remember that recruiters and hiring managers aren't scanning your resume to prove you've cracked open a thesaurus. They want to see evidence that you've made a quantifiable difference in past positions. When in doubt, avoid flowery synonyms and opt for the simplest option.\n\"I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs.\" Those words from Stephen King apply to just about any kind of writing, but they're especially wise when it comes to resumes. Like lengthy synonyms, adverbs and adjectives add nothing to your argument. They're merely taking up space and distracting from the document's substance. Take my use of the word 'lengthy' a few sentences back. What did that add to the point I was trying to make? Not a whole lot. That's not to say you should abandon adverbs altogether. Think of adverbs like candy. In an otherwise healthy diet (or document), they're welcome from time to time. Too many, however, and your body, mind, and resume will suffer.\nA good resume paints a picture of a powerful, active professional. The word 'helped' does neither. It lacks specificity and reflects nothing in the way of authority or ownership. Hiring managers are looking for details that speak to how you've set yourself apart in the past. For all they know, 'helped' means 'made coffee' or 'showed up on time.' Instead of help, select words that speak to the tasks you performed and the tangible results they produced. Don't leave Procurement's recruiters and hiring managers trying to guess what you did for past employers. Make it clear exactly how you'll 'help' them deliver on their objectives.\nYou only get one chance to make a first impression. Make it count by crafting a detailed, specific, and meaningful resume. A good resume isn't the only thing you'll need to get hired, but a bad one is definitely all you'll need to get rejected.",

        "It\u2019s amazing what a difference time can make in the way we perceive certain technologies. A few years ago, the idea of the cloud was terrifying to many people. What exactly did it mean to have something \u201cin the cloud\u201d? Was your personal information just floating around somewhere, ready for people to steal? Now, a lot of those hesitations have disappeared as people learned more about the cloud and its benefits. Businesses and individuals are more than willing to stick their information \u201cin the cloud,\u201d but it\u2019s really not that simple.\nSure, there are plenty of cloud providers in the market, but choosing the right one for your organization can be a tricky process. Brand name cloud providers are often seen as a reliable option for companies, but the truth is that they may not be the right option for your small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) needs.\nMigrating successfully to the cloud requires a SMB to have the right partner by its side, especially if it lacks cloud expertise or the time to develop an appropriate migration strategy. The right partner will be able to ensure that a SMB\u2019s cloud deployment meets regulatory requirements, offers future scalability and flexibility, and/or provides it with the most cost-effective option possible.\nAgain, finding a cloud provider that can do all of the above should be easy, but that\u2019s not always the case. A lot of cloud providers are focused on helping enterprises rather than SMBs. Luckily, there are some cloud providers that cater specifically to SMB customers.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about SMB cloud migrations and how to choose the right cloud provider to meet your company\u2019s needs, be sure to register for the upcoming webinar titled \u201cHow to Know if Your Cloud Decision is Right for Your SMB.\u201d The webinar, presented by Ed Dryer, senior technology strategist at Steadfast, will take place on Tuesday, August 22, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. EDT.\nAttendees will gain a better understanding of public, hybrid and private clouds for SMBs; learn the operational and cost benefits of virtualization; hear what is driving SMBs today to make cloud investments; and understand how cloud services complement business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) services, managed security, and on-demand infrastructure.

        "A professor at the University of Michigan says Ariana Grande can teach Secretary of Defense James Mattis about counterterrorism operations against the Islamic State.\nJuan Cole of the Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies at the University of Michigan published an op-ed this week in which he compares the anti-terrorism philosophies of Mr. Mattis, the former head of U.S. Central Command with over 40 years of military experience, to the singer behind the \"Dangerous Woman\" album. Ms. Grande's message of \"inclusiveness\" following the Manchester, England, terror attack after one of her concerts won out over Mr. Mattis' \"kill them all\" approach.\n\"The strategy of annihilation is sort of like fighting forest fires with gasoline hoses,\" the professor wrote for The Nation in a piece titled \"Ariana Grande Understands Counterterrorism Better Than Jim Mattis.\"\n\"In [a recent] interview, Mattis showed no interest in how ISIL arose in the first place, or how it attracted or gained the tacit cooperation of several million Syrians and Iraqis,\" Mr. Cole wrote of the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. \"He seems to think that a few slick tweets or videos in cyberspace are the problem. The fact is that all the ISIL fighters in Iraq and Syria have siblings and cousins, and simply annihilating them creates a whole slew of new feuds with the United States.\"\nThe professor claimed that Iraq's current instability can be be traced back to \"George W. Bush's war on Iraq,\" the battle for Falluja in 2004 that Mr. Mattis helped engineer as a Marine, and its effects on the Iraqi political process.\n\"Meanwhile, pop singer Ariana Grande, 23, whose concert was attacked by a British ISIL operative in Manchester, announced that she would return to Manchester for a benefit concert for the victims,\" Mr. Cole wrote. \"The second-most-followed person on Instagram stressed that her concert was about inclusiveness and that would not change. ... Her sentiments, the essence of counterinsurgency when it comes to ISIL's polarizing plot, were shared by Manchester Muslims, who marched in solidarity with the victims.\"\nThe professor concluded that Pentagon officials would be wise to follow the singer's Twitter feed because \"she nailed it.\"",

        "\"When asked by CNN's Jake Tapper why it was inexplicably removed, a spokesperson for Christie joked, \"it was too much pain for The Rock.\"\nOh, dear ... the less seen and heard from Chris Christie ... the better for Chris Christie.\nThe best pension reform for the state of New Jersey is to vote Christie out of office. His tax cuts for the wealthy are the reason why the state is running a deficit. But from Christie's point of view, it's the pension that blowing a hole in the budget.\nDidn't he know about the pension before you made your tax cuts? Of course, he did. it's what he was aiming to dismantle, privatize, or otherwise destroy. We cannot let this guy get anywhere near the Oval Office, folks. Tax cuts for the rich, and tax breaks for big business.\nWhy is he still governor?\nBecause there is a wall of silence around the governor. The biggest obstacle is that his staff conducted state business using personal electronic devices and personal media accounts, such as email, which is supposed to be illegal I had thought. In New Jersey, apparently not.\nChristie is more likely to be charged with investor fraud in the second bridge scandal, involving the Pulaski Skyway. He used Port Authority money, which has been designated by law to be used for interstate projects, to fund a state of New Jersey construction project.\nIt would seem that Christie appointees may have once again played a significant role in the events that lead up to the money being improperly diverted. The transfer saved New Jersey taxpayers nearly $2 billion.\nLast I checked, I think Dwayne Johnson is a Republican/conservative, which means that cookin' smell is probably his brain frying under a tinfoil hat. Oh wait....if that's what's making Christie so hungry, does that mean Christie is a zombie?\nERMAHGERD...CHRIS CHRISTIE IS A ZOMBIE!!!!\n\"The in-house produced trailer seemed to promote a series of town hall-style events Christie will host across the state to address what he deems an \"impending fiscal crisis\u201d from the growth of public pension and health benefits and the borrowing needed to service them.\"\n\"Impending fiscal crisis\" that Christie created on purpose by cutting taxes so he could later make the argument he just made as his justification for gutting the pensions, health care funds, and all sorts of other things that benefit the middle class etc. The game is to break us and leave us nothing but completely and utterly beholden to our wealthy employers and their demands and whims. Because hey, if they can't maintain control because of demographic shifts, they're darn well going to try to maintain it via wealth shifts. The GOP/Teatrolls seek to create and have already largely achieved the goal of creating two vastly separate economic classes in this country: the 1% and the serfs.\nWhen the Rock asked \"Can you smell what the Rock is cooking\" Christie started to salivate.\nI agree Rudy, this investor fraud is what's going to hang him, he knew darn well the rules, he even arranged to have the financial assessments if the cost of the train, blew it way, way out of proportion, then killed the project, and he and his cronies voted to use the money for other things, freeing up funds for his tax cuts. These were bonds (municipal)?, specifically allocated for the train, among others. They know he didn't get the investors approval, they know he intentionally lied about the train project, just to kill it, and made himself out to be a saviour in the whole ordeal, nice.

        "BOYNE CITY -- Zachera Wollenberg's first big role was as \"Annie\" when she was 13. The 21-year-old Boyne City native is now finishing up her college career in theater at Michigan State University and stepping into the world of professional stage acting.\nHer final performance before graduating is as Fanny Brice in \"Funny Girl.\" The musical comedy runs April 19-28 at the Wharton Center in East Lansing.\nThe role is a massive one, according to Wollenberg. She will sing 12 songs, has 14 costume changes and the plot is entirely centered around her character.\n\"It has been the hardest thing I have ever done in my life,\" explained the young actress. \"Every time I exit it's a quick change. There's no break. You are just flying through this show. That's kind of what's awesome about it-- to be able to have this challenge.\"\nThe show's director, Devanand Janki, flew in to East Lansing from New York City. Janki has been both an actor and director on Broadway for many years.\n\"At first it was jarring because he worked at speed and it was a little hard to adjust to because we've been functioning in a nurturing educational environment,\" Wollenberg said. \"He came in guns a blazing, but I think we all adjusted pretty well and now we're all working as fast and as hard as he is. Pretty much it's just an honor.\"\nWollenberg says she has been involved in theater her whole life, but started acting seriously in middle school.\n\"I was always involved in theater because my parents (Bob and Jacqueline Wollenberg) ran the drama department at (Boyne City High School) for a long time,\" she said.\nThe time she spent participating in drama at Boyne City High School solidified her passion and made her certain it was what she wanted to do for a career, she said.\n\"I got to focus more seriously on the craft and learn more what it's all about,\" she said. Her favorite memory of her time there was playing Maria in \"West Side Story\" opposite her best friend their senior year.\nSince high school, Wollenberg entered the prestigious Bachelor of Fine Arts program in drama at MSU. She's been in more than 20 productions during her college career, ranging from musicals to classical theater to improvised performance.\nShe also became certified in stage combat and is licensed in three different weapons disciplines such as sword fighting for stage.\nThis summer the 21-year-old will have one of her first paid acting jobs in the world premier of a show, \"10:53,\" at Williamston Theatre near East Lansing.\nThen, in September, she and her boyfriend plan to move to Chicago.\n\"We plan to spend our life there,\" she said. \"I'm really interested in the theater scene in Chicago. It's close knit and there's lots of musical and classical theater. I love the city of Chicago.\"",
        "After compiling the most rushing yards for a Bears rookie in a debut, Matt Forte calmly sat down at his locker, oblivious to the hype surrounding his 123-yard, one-touchdown performance.\n\"I'm glad we won, but I'm not going to go crazy over it,\" Forte said after the Bears' surprising 29-13 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night. \"It's the first game. It's a 16-game season.\"\nSeems as if Forte already has a veteran's savvy. And his confidence was evident all night, particularly after he grabbed a second-quarter pass and absorbed vicious blows from Colts defenders Clint Session and Bob Sanders. They sent Forte out of the game for a few plays and resulted in his left shoulder being heavily taped afterward. But it didn't stop Forte for long.\n\"The shoulder was a little numb,\" he admitted. \"I just went to the sideline and had to shake it off, get back in there and play.\"\nForte's fearless debut was contagious. The Bears played like they had nothing to lose and everyone's respect to gain. The defense swarmed up front and hit the Colts in the mouth early, keeping them out of the end zone in the first half. And this was practically the same Peyton Manning-led offense that outscored opponents 236-134 in first halves last season.\nThe defense kept punching in the second half, with Lance Briggs' 21-yard return of Charles Tillman's forced fumble putting the Bears up 22-13 in the third quarter. It was the second score for the defense, with a first-half safety by Adewale Ogunleye notching two points.\nManning completed 30 of 49 passes for 257 yards and a touchdown but was sacked twice. The Bears outgained the Colts 319-293.\n\"Just another week,\" Briggs said, poking fun at people's anxiety over the exhibition games. \"It's no longer preseason. This is the week that counts.\"\nA Bears team that appeared listless in the preseason suddenly came to life, and Forte provided the biggest jolt. He set the tone with a 50-yard touchdown run in the first quarter.\nThe Bears faced third-and-6 from midfield, and the Colts expected a pass play. Quarterback Kyle Orton handed off to Forte, who dipped through the middle as right guard Roberto Garza drove middle linebacker Gary Brackett to the turf. Forte then showed off his elusiveness, putting a move on defensive back Antoine Bethea before outracing Sanders to the end zone.\nForte reached the 100-yard mark on his 14th carry\u2014a 3-yard run with 24 seconds left in the first half. His total helped the Bears to 183 rushing yards on 39 carries, a healthy 4.7 yards per carry.\nForte's strong effort made life easier on Orton, who looked calm from the first snap. Make that the second, because Olin Kreutz mishandled the first, leading to a false start on the center.\nThat said, the much-maligned offensive line held up well. It gave Orton (13-for-21, 150 yards) ample opportunity to throw and cleared massive holes for Forte. Twice on third down, Orton's protection allowed him to pick up big gains to the tight end, leading to scores.\nOrton carried his confidence into the fourth quarter and made another key third-down conversion: a 26-yard pass to Clark on third-and-1, giving the Bears first-and-goal from the 1. Fullback Jason McKie's 1-yard plunge punctuated an impressive offensive effort.\n\"I know what our offense can be,\" Forte said. \"I had a sense we were going to do well.\"\nThe rest of the football world sure didn't.",
        "THE thriller writer John Le Carr\u00e9 has written for the first time about how his father used him as a child to help trick the victims of numerous swindles.\nUntil now, Le Carr\u00e9, whose real name is David Cornwell, has guarded his privacy jealously: he is seldom interviewed and in 1993 took legal action to prevent the publication of an unauthorised biography.\nWhat emerges in his most detailed account about his father, published in the New Yorker magazine, is a fierce and anguished portrait of a childhood marred by domestic violence, insecurity and abandonment.\nHis father, Ronnie Cornwell - who \"smelled of fine cigars and pear-droppy hair oil from Taylor of Bond Street\" - was a gambler and \"five-star conman\" who spent short stretches in jails all over the world.\n\"Every time I am moved to admire him, I remember his victims,\" writes Le Carr\u00e9. \"His own mother, freshly bereaved, the sobbing executrix of his father's estate; his second wife's mother, also in dazed possession of her late husband's fortune: Ronnie robbed them both . . . Dozens, scores of others, all trusting . . . conned, robbed, ripped off by their knight errant.\"\nA fictionalised version of Mr Cornwell, who is now dead, appears in Le Carre's A Perfect Spy as Rick Pym, the feckless father of the protagonist Magnus.\nLe Carr\u00e9 remembers \"with shame\" several trips he and his brother Tony were dispatched upon to reassure his father's swindled creditors that their money was on the way; from the Panamanian ambassador in Paris to a pair of pensioners in Chalfont St Peter.\nIn the case of the pensioners, le Carr\u00e9 writes: \"With profound reluctance we went, and drank their sherry, and did our feeble best to vouch for Ronnie's integrity, while Sir Eric and his lady peered at us with terrified disbelief.\n\"'We're living on our pension,' Sir Eric explained, as to children, 'and a little bit of capital my wife inherited. We've given them to your father to invest'.\"\nThey asked for an assurance that Mr Cornwell could be trusted but Le Carr\u00e9 cannot recall what he and Tony replied.\nIn the 1950s, Mr Cornwell staged what Le Carr\u00e9 calls his \"biggest public failure\", involving \u00a31.25 million.\nAt this point several documents bearing Le Carr\u00e9's signature \"in my capacity as an officer of one of his 80-something worthless companies\" came under legal scrutiny.\n\"But I didn't remember signing the documents, or accepting a post in any of his companies,\" he writes. \"Whether I told the receiver this, or lied to protect Ronnie, I simply forget.\"\nLe Carre went on to serve in MI5, and recalls the head of personnel asking him: \" 'Forgiven your father yet?' 'Oh, long ago, sir,' I reply with Ronnie's angelic smile. And that's another thing I've inherited from him. The mask of sanity.\"\nMr Cornwell's darker side also manifested itself in domestic violence. He beat both his first and second wives and, though less frequently, his son.\nLe Carr\u00e9 recalls sleeping on a mattress in front of his stepmother Jean's bedroom door, armed with a golf iron, in the hope of protecting her from his father.\n\"Killing him was an early preoccupation of mine,\" he writes, \"and it has endured off and on even after his death.\"\nOlive, the mother who Le Carr\u00e9 says \"never\" hugged him, ran away from their house in Rickmansworth, Herts, when he was only five years old. He did not see her until 16 years later. \"I rediscovered her in Suffolk, the mother of two other children\".\nShe still talked obsessively about Mr Cornwell. She told Le Carr\u00e9 that his father had \"mortgaged\" his own head for \u00a350 to medical science, \"cash in advance and the goods to be delivered on his death\".\nStrangely, she spoke about him in the second person. Asked why she had left her children behind, she said: \"Because you'd have come after us, darling. You wouldn't have rested until you got your precious boys back.\"\nDuring the intervening time, Mr Cornwell had led his two sons to believe that their mother had first fallen into immorality, and then died.\nLe Carr\u00e9 still keeps the single white leather Harrods suitcase that she took with her when she left. He discovered it in her cottage when she died.\n\"The only thing in the whole house that bore witness to her first marriage,\" he writes.\nShe left the brothers an audiotape on which she described their life together. Le Carr\u00e9 says he still cannot bear to listen to it.\nMr Cornwell's freeloading depended on inventiveness and a magnetic charm.\nDuring rationing, Mr Cornwell managed to pay his son's prep school fees in contraband: black market dried fruit and a case of \"unobtainable\" gin.\nHe twice stood for parliament, the first time as a dodge to escape National Service.\nHis charm attracted the great and good, including the cricketer Don Bradman, leading judges and barristers, ex-Lord Mayors and ranking Scotland Yard police officers, to parties at his home.\nBut the charm was only skin deep. Le Carr\u00e9 talks of \"real blood on the carpet, real wrecked lives and broken hearts\".\nOne of Mr Cornwell's associates committed suicide in a London hotel room. \"He wrecked as he created,\" writes Le Carr\u00e9.\nAfter Le Carr\u00e9 became successful he would receive actorly calls from his father begging him to bail him out of prison. \"Sobs . . . that as usual go through me like slow knives.\"\nAfter Le Carr\u00e9 published the novel The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, his father enjoyed VIP treatment at a film studio by announcing himself as his son's \"business adviser\".\nNeither his son, nor Paramount Pictures, which owned the film rights to the novel, had any idea he was there.\nLe Carr\u00e9 writes: \"I keep few letters, and most of Ronnie's to me were so awful I destroyed them almost before I read them: begging letters from America, India, Singapore and Indonesia; hortatory letters forgiving me my trespasses and urging me to love him, pray for him, make the best use of the advantages he had lavished on me, and send him money; bullying demands that I repay the cost of my education; and doom-laden prognostications of his imminent death.\n\"I don't regret having thrown them away; sometimes I wish I could throw away the memory of them, too.\"",
        "Invicea Labs researchers have discovered two zero-day vulnerabilities in Belkin\u2019s home automation devices.\nLONDON, UK \u2013 Research director Scott Tenaglia and lead research engineer Joe Tanen detailed the vulnerabilities during their \u2018Breaking BHAD: Abusing Belkin Home Automation devices\u2019 talk at the Black Hat Europe conference in London last Friday.\nThe zero-day flaws specifically relate to Belkin\u2019s smart home products and accompanying Android mobile application, which is used to wirelessly control the home automation devices.\nThe first flaw, a SQL injection vulnerability, enables would-be hackers to inject malicious code into the paired Android WeMo smartphone app, and thus take root control of the connected home automation device.\n\u201cWe found two zero-day vulnerabilities. One of them allows you to remotely root any WeMo device, and the other one allow you to do cross-site scripting, and execute arbitrary code inside the Android app for WeMo devices,\u201d said Tenaglia, speaking to CSO Online on Friday.\nThe WeMo product range launched in 2012 and today includes several devices, including connected room heaters, coffee makers and humidifiers. Belkin claims to have sold 1.5 million devices to date.\nPrior to the demonstration on Friday, the researchers disclosed these vulnerabilities, with Belkin issuing updates for the firmware (10884 and 10885) for the SQL injection vulnerability in November, and for the mobile application (now version 1.15.2) in August.\nThe SQL injection vulnerability led the Invincea Labs duo to carry out a \u201ctextbook\u201d SQL injection attack.\nIn this case, researchers found they could inject data into the databases used by the WeMo devices, to take control of the Belkin WeMo Switch device (*the flaw is also presence in WeMo-compatible Crock-Pot, and most likely in other WeMo devices too).\nThe WeMo mobile app, which is available for iOS and Android, lets users create \u2018rules\u2019 to control Belkin devices. As one example, one such rule may be for a connected lamp to automatically turn off each night at 10pm.\nThese rules can be configured on the app and pushed to the Belkin WeMo device over the local network as an SQLite database file. On receiving the file, the device decompresses it and uses a set of SQL queries to pull rule information from the new database and update its in-memory rules.\nTenaglia and Tanen found an SQL injection flaw in this configuration, potentially enabling attackers to write an arbitrary file on the device in a location of their choosing, and for the device to execute on the file.\nThere is no authentication or encryption used for device communication over the local network, meaning anyone \u2013 and any device - can send the malicious SQLite file to the Belkin device assuming they are on the same network.\nTenaglia and Tanen exploited the flaw to create a second SQLite database on the device that would be interpreted as a shell script by the command interpreter. They placed the file in a specific location from where it would be automatically executed by the device's network subsystem on restarting the device.\nOn restart, they gained root control over the device and could run Telnet (although they say hackers could run anything at this point),). Tenaglia and Tanen said at the conference that this technique could be used for DDoS attack or causing the IoT product to malfunction, such as overheat.\n\"We could easily run Mirai on this\u2026. The only real remediation is a firmware update,\u201d said Tanen at Black Hat Europe.\nBoth researchers praised Belkin for the speed in which they responded. Both firmware vulnerabilities were verified on the same day within an hour, while Belkin released a patch for the Android app on September 1st. The firmware update was available as of 1st November.\nYet Tanen told CSO that hackers can kill the firmware update process entirely: \u201cOnce you\u2019re on the device, the firmware update process just runs the script. We could easily remove that file, or modify that script.\nThe second vulnerability involves the running of malicious code on the Android app.\nAs an example, when a user would open the device in the app, instead of displaying \u201cUpstairs Baby Monitor,\u201d the phone would execute the malicious code input in the \u2018friendly\u2019 name.\nBoth techniques required no root access to the phone, simply for the app to be active or running in memory on the phone.\nTenaglia and Tanen told CSO Online that Belkin has been \u2018very responsive\u2019 to their report, even earmarking them as one of the better IoT vendors for security.\nOn IoT security, the researchers are worried about the possibility for such vulnerabilities to lead onto \u2018second and third factor\u2019 attacks, such as credit card details being stolen from connected devices.\n\u201cPeople want to integrate IoT devices into everything now\u2026The more stuff is gets integrated into, the more real-world consequences you\u2019re going to have when someone else gains control,\u201d added Tanen.\nHe said that IoT devices are susceptible to \u2018low hanging fruit\u2019 attacks like XML injection attacks.\nTanen urges vendors to ensure they restrict privileges with their IoT devices, while Tenaglia says adopting businesses should build security design stack with third-parties and get help with security assessment.",
        "Take A Deep Breath: That Clarinet Could Be A Germ Factory : Shots - Health News Researchers found bacteria, mold and fungus in tests of more than a dozen children's band instruments. The parts musicians put in their mouths were the most contaminated.\nPlaying music in the band is good for kids, but maybe not so much if that clarinet is a cesspool of bacteria and fungi.\nThat's the provocative suggestion from the Oklahoma State University for Health Sciences, where researchers found germs galore growing on brass and wind instruments that were used in high school band programs.\nThe researchers in Oklahoma City Tulsa swabbed 13 brass and wind instruments, then rubbed the swabs on petri dishes and waited to see what would grow. They found 295 different bacteria as well as yeasts and molds. The parts that musicians put in their mouths were more contaminated than the rest of the instruments, and the two clarinets showed more contamination than the other instruments. The results were published in the latest issue of General Dentistry.\nOK, that's gross. But does having bacteria in your bassoon really pose a health risk?\nYes, says Thomas Glass, a dentist and professor at Oklahoma State who was lead author of the study. In the past he has tested for pathogens on toothbrushes, dentures, and athletic mouthguards. So he wasn't too surprised to find gunk growing on band instruments. \"The bacteria can produce local infections in the mouth, in the gastrointestinal tract, and in the respiratory tract,\" Glass tells Shots. Molds can cause allergic reactions, and skin infections are a risk, too, he says.\nGlass's study didn't look to see if the high schoolers who played these grubby instruments had health problems. And there's precious little evidence of rampant infections associated with practicing \"Stars and Stripes Forever.\"\nBut a few pulmonologists have reported patients coming in with lung problems. A letter from 1988 in the journal Chest told the tale of a 67-year-old saxophone player with a cough and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed with hypersensitivity pulmonitis from candida, and it turned out the saxophone mouthpiece was contaminated with that fungus. The symptoms disappeared after the musician started washing the instrument's mouthpiece with soap and water.\nMore recently, a 48-year-old French saxophonist with inflamed lungs from a moldy saxophone also got a write-up in Chest. In the same issue last September, a pulmonologist at the University of Connecticut Health Center reported on a 35-year-old professional trombone player who had been suffering from a cough and shortness of breath for 15 years. Those symptoms cleared up when the musician started cleaning his instrument with rubbing alcohol.\nNow, we have to point out that the General Dentistry study was sponsored by Dr. Lorenzo Lepore founder of Encore Etc., Inc. It turns out that Lepore is a dentist, and Encore Etc., Inc. is a company he founded to sterilize musical instruments.\nWe are independent of any conflict of interest. All we have to do in the article is say how we're funded. That has no impact on us in terms of our findings.\nEthylene oxide is used to sterilize medical instruments, and it does a very good job. It's also pretty toxic to humans. So we don't think that you're going to be cleaning your mellophone at home with this stuff.\nShots can't help but ask if the good doctor isn't being a wee bit alarmist. \"Alarmist? We worry about that, we always worry about being alarmist,\" he tells us. \"It's not going to hurt anybody to break down their instrument once a week and clean it.\" That, he says, is preventive health.\n\"Playing a musical instrument has a certain level of hazard,\" Glass says. \"You can minimize the hazard by being fastidious.\"",
        "Bangalore: Sonia Sharma never imagined she would go cold on ice cream. Yet, that\u2019s what the 26-year old Bangalore-based finance company executive, who used to consume 2 litres of Baskin-Robbins ice cream a week, has done.\nBlame it on the slowdown. \u201cI\u2019m thinking twice before spending every penny. I want to save for a rainy day,\" says Sharma.\nSharma isn\u2019t alone. As companies cut salaries and jobs, and the slowdown becomes a certainty from a mere possibility, people are tightening the purse strings. Delhi-based economics research firm Indicus Analytics Pvt. Ltd says so-called discretionary spending will grow at 4.5% this fiscal compared with 15-16% a year for the past four years.\n\u201cThis is going to be one of the slowest, if not the slowest year of the decade (in terms of discretionary spending),\" says Amit Sinha, president, Indicus. Its finding, released in October, is based on a survey of households across income categories and across India.\nSince October, estimates on the rate at which the global and Indian economies will grow this year and next have been significantly downscaled \u2014which means that discretionary spending could slow more than Indicus\u2019 estimates, maybe even contract.\nIn recent weeks, the International Monetary Fund has said India is expected to grow 7.8% in 2008 and 6.3% next year, while the World Bank put it at 6.3% and 5.8%, respectively.\nIn India, Indicus says discretionary spending has been growing faster than so-called consumption expenditure which involves spending on products and services people cannot do without such as food at home, apparel, housing, education and health care and which has been growing at 9-10% a year for five years.\nThe number itself is significant enough to make or break several hundreds of companies. According to Indicus, discretionary spending for the year ending March will be Rs1.24 trillion, against Rs1.08 trillion for the year ended March 2007 (the company conducts its survey every two years). In comparison, consumption expenditure is expected to touch Rs26.8 trillion in fiscal 2009.\n\u201cWe have seen sales of music, movies, toys and gifts dropping in the last three months,\" says Himanshu Chakrawarti, chief operating officer, Landmark, a retail chain with 11 stores across India and part of Trent Ltd, a Tata group company. \u201cWe were growing 20-25% year-on-year (in the category of music, movies, toys and gifts). However, with sales down, we expect to grow by a single \u2018mid\u2019 digit this year (in this segment).\"\nHe says sales have fallen sharply in cities such as Bangalore, Gurgaon and Pune \u2014all hubs for the information technology and back-office services business.\nIndicus\u2019 Sinha says the fall in discretionary spending will be sharp in cities that benefited from the boom of the past three years when the economy expanded by at least 9% a year. \u201cConsumer confidence has declined most significantly in these cities,\" he adds.\nAnd when that happens, consumers such as Sonia Sharma go off ice cream.\nBaskin-Robbins India, which has 340 stores countrywide, says it will grow 25-30% this year, down from 40% last year. \u201cFootfalls (the number of visitors) at malls have come down to 30-40%, which has affected our business,\" says chief executive Pankaj Chaturvedi.\nIn New Delhi, Pawan Gadia, vice-president, Ferns \u2019N\u2019 Petals Group, a flower retailer with outlets across India, says corporate orders have halved but retail sales are unaffected.\nAt Infiniti Retail Ltd, a Tata group that runs a chain of electronics stores under the Croma brand name, says the number of people coming to Croma outlets in malls is down 10%, but \u201cthis is not something that worries me, as long as customers buy,\" says Ajit Joshi, chief executive and managing director, adding that his company\u2019s business has not suffered.",
        "You start by hearing Echo And The Bunnymen, and finish up with Tears For Fears. In between, there's a fantastic tale, and a vision of a rabbit. And yes, until recently, the place you'd be most likely to witness all this would be in Richard Kelly's excellent movie Donnie Darko.\nLately, though, it's become difficult not to recognise that an individual hearing epic and adventurous pop music of the 1980s wherever they go might not necessarily be such a far-fetched idea.\nThe vocal inflections of the Cure's Robert Smith in the music of the Rapture and Hot Hot Heat. The grand and cinematic guitar epics of Echo And The Bunnymen in the excellent album by the Stills, or material by the Open or Longview. The intelligent and funky avant rock of Gang Of Four or Japan in the likes of Franz Ferdinand. Even in No Doubt's recent cover version of Talk Talk's magnificent It's My Life.\nTo some, dry ice will forever remain frozen carbon dioxide, that versatile refrigerant. To the 1980s rock band, however, it and its cousin the smoke machine helped to plunge the audience into a state of personal disorientation as great as that of the band they had come to see. A theatrical masterstroke, it additionally brought to the student union of the incumbent provincial university a flavour of the Mekong Delta. \"I like to think it was the songs that made this band,\" said Andrew Eldritch from the Sisters Of Mercy. \"I know it wasn't. We used a lot of smoke, and made a space where you could lose yourself.\"\nBeneath the long overcoats, discontent was often simmering in the 1980s band. With drugs and egomania holding them ransom in 1987, for example, Echo And The Bunnymen once flew their US management across America to arbitrate between them. Fried on psychedelic drugs during the sessions for their third album, Julian Cope chased Teardrop Explodes keyboard player David Balfe (later boss of Food Records and subject of Blur's Country House) across the Welsh countryside with a shotgun. King of feuds, however, was to be found in the Cure, between singer Robert Smith and former schoolfriend Lol Tolhurst. Asked why he victimised his drummer/keyboard player, Smith replied: \"Because he's so useless.\"\nIf existence precedes essence, it certainly never did so as convincingly as when accompanied by guitars. In 1979, the Cure's first single Killing An Arab provided a condensed version of the Camus story The Outsider, while in the 1980s they persevered gamely, taking the essential tenets of dread and anxiety with them wherever they went. Echo And The Bunnymen, meanwhile, took the ideas of personal freedom and commitment to the next level. \"This reaching beyond your grasp, self against the universe-type theme,\" says Wayne Coyne from the Flaming Lips, \"was, to me, what the band embodied all along.\"\nOn the cusp of the late 1970s and early 1980s, a lot of kudos could be gained by presenting oneself not as a pop group, but as much like a citizen of an eastern bloc country as was possible without actually having to wear a headscarf and queue for vegetables. The influential sloganeering of Gang Of Four, the tendency of Wire to speak about their group in the third person, might have been meticulously thought out and deliberately unromantic decisions, but, perversely, they only contributed to these groups' mystique. This was an odd world of communiqu\u00e9 and manifesto, and it still (witness Franz Ferdinand, British Sea Power and Bloc Party) enjoys a considerable allure.\nLater, he would be an A&R man at WEA, a Timelord and one of the KLF, but in 1980 ex-art school student (see below: Attend art school) Bill Drummond was manager of the Teardrop Explodes and Echo And The Bunnymen. Examples of his client care included: considering the \"death\" of Ian McCulloch, thinking it might boost record sales; becoming obsessed with the notion of who, mythically-speaking, \"The Bunnymen\" might have been, and toying with becoming singer of Killing Joke. All, nonetheless, helped his bands on to glory.\nIf Paul Weller and the Jam made music that bore an unbearably close resemblance to the grimness of 1980s life, there were those who could not be touched by such temporal things. Japan's David Sylvian and Talk Talk's Mark Hollis made triumphant, completely unmarketable records (Brilliant Trees; Spirit Of Eden) at the peak of their commercial success. Mike Scott of the Waterboys made music he described as \"a metaphor for seeing God's signature in the world\". Even Tears For Fears spent years endlessly refining what they held to be their masterwork, Seeds Of Love. Last word, though, goes to Julian Cope. He invented an alternate world where he was called Kevin Stapleton, and his band was called Whopper. It didn't really work out, no.\nOr, as the shorthand had it then, \"be produced by Steve Lillywhite\". He was young, he was cool and his brother was in the Members. But most significantly, prodigious lord of the soundboard Lillywhite wasn't averse to slotting in sessions with surly 23-year-olds in black clothes in between performing high-profile, big-budget duties for more mature clients like Peter Gabriel, Simple Minds, U2, the Psychedelic Furs ... they entered his court wanting to sound like the Velvet Underground (see below: Listen to the Velvet Underground). They emerged pristine and echoing, and just a touch heroic.\nIn the 1960s, a place to smoke Woodbines and enthuse about Lonnie Donegan. In the late 1970s, though, this was the place to buy wholesale into the holy trinity of Bowie, Velvet Underground (see below: Listen to the Velvet Underground) and Warhol that was to be the staple diet of the post-punk new waver and their sunglasses-at-night regime. Not so much a place of further education, more a state of mind, Bill Drummond went, as did Richard Butler of the Psychedelic Furs, who took the Warhol fascination to a new level of dedication. \"I was working at a silkscreen place in Barnet,\" he said of the band's beginnings. \"It was a very confused time.\"\nA sense of the portentous and occasionally mystical could often hang over live events in the 1980s. Particular offenders in this respect might be seen to be the Cure, who during a particularly dark period performed The Fourteen Explicit Moments tour (and then lightened up shortly afterwards). Meanwhile, in 1980 Echo And The Bunnymen could be found playing in venues under the influence of Apocalypse Now and, more specifically, under a huge canopy of camouflage. On another occasion, they played an apparently random series of locations. \"It's not random,\" said Bill Drummond at the time (see above: Get a strange manager). \"If you look at a map of the world, the tour's in the shape of a rabbit's ears.\"\nOh, go on. A bit more can't hurt, can it?",
        "The WWE WrestleMania 34 results are already coming in as the men\u2019s Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal match took place as part of the Kickoff Show. This year\u2019s edition of the match made for the fifth installment and featured several former winners competing to win the trophy for the second time in their career. Former winners Baron Corbin and Mojo Rawley were among the final competitors too, as they looked to claim yet another big win ahead of the WrestleMania 34 pay-per-view.\nAs reported on Sunday night by Pro Wrestling, the big men\u2019s battle royal featured a number of competitors who weren\u2019t previously announced, as well as those superstars who were. They included The Ascension, Kane, Breezango, The Revival, Shelton Benjamin, Chad Gable, Goldust, Dolph Ziggler, Zack Ryder, Matt Hardy, Heath Slater, Titus O\u2019Neil, Apollo Crews, and Rhyno.\nThroughout the match, various competitors hit some exciting spots including Ziggler skinning the cat by hanging onto the ropes to prevent elimination several times. In other parts of the match, Kane shoved multiple opponents out of the ring at once. Mojo Rawley hit a huge shoulder tackle on Ryder as he was preparing for a running move, which eliminated Ryder from the match.\nZiggler, Kane, and Goldust all ended up being eliminated from the match too, leaving an interesting final three competitors. It came down to \u201cWoken\u201d Matt Hardy battling former winners Mojo Rawley and \u201cThe Lone Wolf\u201d Baron Corbin. Hardy got the crowd to join him in a \u201cDelete\u201d chant, but soon found the odds stacked against him. Until a sound effect hit and the lights went out briefly.\nOnce the lights returned, Bray Wyatt had returned in the ring. Wyatt ended up helping out Matt Hardy, who eliminated Mojo Rawley. Wyatt battled with Baron Corbin, who would put him down with the End of Days. However, Matt Hardy was ready to delete Corbin from the match after that. Soon after, the bell rang, making Matt Hardy the 2018 Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal winner.\nAfter the big victory, the crowd chanted \u201cThank You Wyatt\u201d as Matt hugged Bray. Just weeks ago, Hardy had defeated Wyatt in the Ultimate Deletion match on WWE Raw. When Bray\u2019s body wasn\u2019t discovered in the Lake of Reincarnation after the match, it led to speculation as to when Bray would return to action. It now looks like fans have their answer and that Bray may have aligned himself with Matt Hardy\u2019s cause.\nWWE\u2019s WrestleMania 34 results took place at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana on Sunday night.",
        "Vince Russo On Why Seth Rollins Isn't A Draw, Rollins - Shawn Michaels, Why Roman Reigns Was Booed - Wrestling Inc.\nAs noted, former professional wrestling writer, producer, and performer, Vince Russo recently debuted his Nuclear Heat podcast with Wrestling Inc. last week. During the debut episode, Russo talked about why Roman Reigns got booed at Royal Rumble 2015 and why Seth Rollins is not over with the fans.\nAccording to Russo, Reigns got booed out of the building at Royal Rumble 2015 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania because WWE unnecessarily put Daniel Bryan in the over-the-top-rope battle royal and Reigns was left in the match with other performers who had no chance of winning and going on to headline WrestleMania 31.\n\"It had a lot to do with putting Daniel Bryan in that match, which they didn't have to put him in, having him eliminated, leaving Reigns in there with three other guys that had no chance of winning the match, so they put Reigns in a horrible position. The people booed him out of the building.\" Russo continued, \"From that day on, from where I sit, my professional opinion is that the WWE has been catering to the internet, the internet wrestling community, the small audience with the loudest voice! Everything they said they weren't going to do, now they are doing. They are catering to that crowd, which they already have. The casual fans are no longer there.\"\nRusso claimed that during Attitude Era Vince McMahon instructed the WWE writing staff to ignore the IWC and focus on attracting casual viewers.\n\"I can remember back in the day working for the WWE, we were told to ignore the internet. 'Don't read what the internet is saying; that is the minority with the loudest voice; those are traditional wrestling fans that are going to watch the product no matter what'\", Russo added, \"The key to success is to go out and get those casual television viewers and make wrestling cool again. That's what the Attitude Era was all about.\"\nAlso, on the premiere episode of Nuclear Heat, Russo stated that Rollins is not over because his character has been written in such a way that makes it impossible for the audience to connect with him.\n\"Seth Rollins is a great wrestler, Seth Rollins is not over,\" Russo said. \"The reason Seth Rollins is not over is because creative has butchered his character. He [has] got more personalities than Sybil. One week, he's running away. The next week, he's standing up to Dean Ambrose. The next week, he's running away. The next week, he's standing up to Triple H. There have been so many changes with this Seth Rollins, there is no way anybody in the audience can be emotionally attached to him.\"\nRusso went on to compare Rollins to WWE Hall of Famer, Shawn Michaels.\n\"[If] you want to see the difference in what I am talking about, go back to the Attitude Era and watch [when] Shawn Michaels was the [WWE] Champion. Watch the consistency of his character. He always stayed true to himself! Seth Rollins is a Duncan Yo-Yo, it's up, it's down, up and down, up and down, up and down.\"\nClick here to check out the rest of the debut episode.

        "After much anticipation, Snapchat's parent company finally debuts on the stock market. It gets off to a fast start.\nSnapchat is officially a public company.\nSnapchat, the disappearing-photo app that's an all-consuming obsession for young people, is coming of age.\nIn one of the most anticipated tech IPOs in years, its parent company, Snap, went public Thursday morning, with a preopen share price set at $17.\nThat price didn't last long. Snap shares started trading just before 11:30 a.m. ET with an opening price of $24, a jump of 41 percent and a strong signal that investors are buying into the young company's promise. During the course of the day, the stock price came within a few cents of $26 before settling to close at $24.48, a first-day gain of 44 percent.\nThe co-founders, CEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Bobby Murphy, rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares are trading under the ticker symbol SNAP.\nSnap is hoping to raise more than $3 billion with its IPO, money it's going to use to do things like hire more employees or make acquisitions.\nIf you haven't been keeping up, Snap has been one of tech's unlikeliest success stories in years. Started by Spiegel, a 26-year-old Stanford University dropout, the app was once dismissed as a sexting app before finding massive adoption among teens and young adults.\nNow the Los Angeles-based social network is emerging as one of the biggest threats to Facebook and Twitter. Its claim to fame: popularizing casual social networking. Since posts quickly disappear, people don't have to worry about their photos and videos being around or impressive enough to stand the test of time. What Snap has shown is that people can feel comfortable posting anything, from the mundane to amusing.\nAnd young people love it. Nearly 70 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds in the US use the app, according to ComScore. More than 150 million people use the service every day.\nThat's why Snap has drawn the ire and envy of Silicon Valley's biggest companies. Most notably, Facebook is trying to duplicate its product mojo, with a near-identical clone of Snapchat Stories, which lets people post strings of videos and photos that self-detonate after 24 hours.\nStill, the company has its challenges. In its IPO filing released last month, Snap warned of slowing user growth. That explains why Spiegel is hoping to convince investors it's not merely a social media company, but instead a \"camera company.\"\nSnap has already released Spectacles, $130 sunglasses equipped with a camera to make it easy for people to post photos and videos to Snapchat. The company also reportedly has worked on a drone for photographing people from overhead.\n\"In the way that the flashing cursor became the starting point for most products on desktop computers, we believe that the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones,\" the company wrote in its IPO filing. \"This means that we are willing to take risks in an attempt to create innovative and different camera products that are better able to reflect and improve our life experiences.\"\nBut even though Snap had a good first day on the market, that doesn't mean it's in the clear. Twitter, which went public in 2013, had a very successful debut on the stock market, with its shares popping 73 percent. Four years later, the company is struggling to get mainstream users beyond celebrities and media types and to make money off its products.\nFacebook, on the other hand, had what many characterized as a disappointing first day on the market in 2012. Now, of course, it has almost 2 billion users and is a perennial Wall Street darling.\nIn a note to investors late Thursday, Aegis Capital listed a number of concerns about Snap's business, including the lack of an ecosystem, lack of a clear path toward profitability, the mix and targeting of ads, and \"the ease by which ... Facebook has been replicating parts of Snapchat's product.\" It set a year-end target of $22 for Snap's shares.\nStill, there's a positive in Snapchat's allure for young people. \"We conducted extensive checks within the ad industry,\" Aegis' Victor Anthony wrote, \"and find that marketers are enthusiastic about the prospects of creating ads to get in front of Snap's coveted demographic.\"\nThe thing to remember is that an IPO is just one day. Now that Snap is a public company, a new marathon begins.\n\"We built our business on creativity,\" Spiegel told the LA Times on Thursday after the shares started trading. \"And we're going to have to go through an education process for the next five years to explain to people how our users and that creativity creates value.\"\nFirst published March 2 at 6:55 a.m. PT.\nUpdated several times, most recently March 3 at 6:02 a.m. PT: On Thursday, added the opening share price for Snap shares and, later, the closing price for the day and analysis as well as more background information. On Friday, added comment from Aegis Capital.",
        "Trump on Charlottesville - stated the \u2018obvious\u2019 or is he \u2018emotionally with KKK\u2019?\nUS President Donald Trump has denounced the violence that erupted on Saturday in the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, saying both the far right and the left are to blame for the bloody clashes.\nHe was initially criticized for not explicitly condemning white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville.\nTrump also questioned the mounting campaign against Confederate monuments, saying that it could lead the US down a slippery slope and warned statues of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington could be the next to fall if the trend continues.\nUS mainstream media have been quick to paint Trump as a sympathizer of neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\n\u201cI think they were just looking for any opportunity to fault him for saying what was obvious to anybody who watched that footage \u2013 which was there was violence coming from both sides,\u201d Jim Jatras told RT.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, for months in this country we\u2019ve had this so-called Antifa, the so-called anti-fascist who frankly are fascists themselves, who use these Stormtrooper tactics to attack violently people they disagree with. They call them \u2018racists\u2019 even if they are not racists. You have people who can\u2019t speak on college campuses \u2013 they\u2019ll attack you if you wear a \u201cMake America great again\u201d hat and they\u2019ve been doing it with impunity,\u201d he added.\nAccording to the former diplomat, Trump was the right to call them out. \u201cOf course he\u2019s going to denounce, and rightly so, people who are in fact Nazis or Klansmen or things of their sort. But let\u2019s not pretend that these people in black with the masks and the clubs are innocent,\u201d he said.\nTrump has faced mounting pressure from lawmakers and the media to condemn the far right in stronger terms. However, the President said both sides of the conflict are to blame because \u201cit has the virtue of being true,\u201d Jatras said.\n\u201cWhere is the Justice Department Task Force, the civil rights Task Force looking into Antifa, and where their funding is coming from, and who is directing their violent activities. That side of the ledger is not shown. Frankly, I think the Republicans are just as complicit in this as the Democrats,\u201d he added.\nFollowing the Charlottesville clashes, some American cities rushed to remove Confederate-era monuments. According to Brian Becker, these statues commemorate people who took up arms against the US government in defense on slavery.\n\u201cThese have been longstanding symbols of white supremacy and the defense of Jim Crow and Apartheid in America,\u201d he told RT.\n\u201cThis would be like having a monument in Russia to Nazi Germany \u2013 that is what this means. These are the people who took up arms against the US government in defense of the system of slavery. Black people should not be forced to bow and walk in front of these monuments that are testimonials and celebration of their enslavement,\u201d Becker continued.\n\u201cThe Washington Monument, the [Thomas] Jefferson Memorial, which are also monuments of slaveholders \u2013 that is not the point \u2013 these monuments have been built not as a national historical thing \u2013 it is about the white supremacy movement erecting them at the times in American history in the 1890\u2019s and in the early 1920\u2019s and right before that, when there was an effort to push back against black freedom,\u201d he said.\nJohn Griffing, investigative reporter: Clearly both sides [of the clash in Charlottesville] were spurring for a fight. These were two very highly charged energized groups of people, but one had a permit to be there, and the other group did not have a permit to be there. And the police stood by, stood down, if you will, and allowed this violence to take place, and did not intervene. That is their dereliction of duty.\n\u201cLook at what happened yesterday \u2013 he was reading. He had to read a prepared statement. Somebody else wrote it for him because he was under so much pressure,\u201d he told RT.\n\u201cOn Saturday when the young woman was killed, and so many were injured as a consequence of neo-Nazi fascist violence Trump couldn\u2019t bring himself to say anything against them. So finally the pressure mounted and he read a prepared statement, and then he did his deed,\u201d Becker continued.\n\u201cBut what we saw today was the real Donald Trump, and he is really angry at the left. The people who came out and provided protection and security from this organization,\u201d said analyst.\n\u201cThey are America\u2019s terrorists. 10,000 black people have been lynched in America \u2013 the KKK celebrated that. These people are not just another conservative right-wing group, and Trump actually stands with them, he is emotionally with them,\u201d he added.",

Fairgoers\u2019 love of the pepper steak \u2014 equal in popularity only to the strawberry shortcake, which returned last year \u2014 prompted lines out of the door of the building where the steaks were sold.\nDiPietro died in 2006, but his sons, Fred and Mike DiPietro were going through their dad\u2019s things this year when they happened upon the old recipes and thought it might be fun to bring back the original sandwich. By coincidence, Fair Manager Valerie Merklin had been thinking the same thing and called to find out if they\u2019d be interested.\nWell. not quite everything. The DiPietro brothers started working at the Pepper Steak House when they were just kids. They worked the register, moved up to slicing meat and peppers and did anything else that was needed during 15-hour days. That was back when the fair was a 10-day extravaganza.

        "Uber is now facing tough questions from Congress over a data breach last year that affected as many as 57 million user and driver accounts. It was revealed last week that the ride-hailing company paid $100,000 to hackers who accessed the user data in exchange for their silence.\nThe incident, which occurred more than a year ago and was kept under wraps, has raised concerns about what a responsible disclosure should look like in the wake of a major security breach. Furthermore, questions linger over whether Uber was acting in the best interest of its users or whether it was mostly concerned about its own image when it paid the hackers to delete the stolen data.\nThe stolen data, which included email addresses, phone numbers, and driver\u2019s license numbers, was discovered by hackers on an Amazon server, which they accessed using credentials lifted from a private GitHub site used by Uber software engineers. Although it could be argued that handing over $100,000 to hackers is a small price to pay\u2014the so called \u201ccost of doing business\u201d\u2014there doesn\u2019t seem to be any conceivable way that Uber could\u2019ve ensured that the hackers actually deleted the data after receiving their hush money.\nBoth Joe Sullivan, Uber\u2019s chief security officer, and Craig Clark, a lawyer who reported to him, were fired because of the incident. On Thursday it was reported that Uber\u2019s new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over for Travis Kalanick following a string of scandals, became aware of the breach two weeks after becoming CEO. However, Uber waited for an additional two months to disclose the incident.\nNow, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are pressuring Uber to reveal further details behind the \u201ctroubling\u201d reports of how the company handled the hack.\nMost states have specific laws in place for handling data breaches on this scale, which includes a patchwork of notification requirements. In some states, public notification is required within 30 days of when the company learns of the breach and may even require the company to notify the media when a considerable number of consumers are impacted. In California, for example, a company involved in a major breach is required to \u201cconspicuously\u201d post information about the breach on its website.\nAccording to reports, Uber\u2019s systems were breached after the attackers discovered log-in credentials to an AWS account used to handle payments. Why weren\u2019t more robust access management mechanisms, including strong multi-factor authentication, enabled to prevent unauthorized access to passenger and driver data?\nWho conducted the initial investigation for Uber that successfully identified the hackers? What \u201cassurances\u201d were provided by the hackers to prove they did, in fact, delete the compromised data?\nUnlike ransomware payments, in which payment is made to recover or regain access to inaccessible data or systems, it appears the motivation behind this payment was principally to prevent the public or authorities from learning of the breach. What rationale was provided by senior executives for covering up this breach?\n\u201c[T]he nature of the information currently acknowledged to have been compromised, together with the allegation that the company concealed the breach without notifying affected drivers and consumers, and prior privacy concerns at Uber, make this a serious incident that merits further scrutiny,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.",

Everyone brought a favorite title, and we spent all afternoon raving about the books we had shared and loved, cried and laughed over.\nIt might be cliche, but I believe a book is the gift that keeps on giving.\nHere are my selections for the 21st annual Wilde Awards \u2013 picture books organized by age.\nThis year I will present the winners at Flyleaf Books in Chapel Hill on Dec. 6 and Quail Ridge Books on Dec. 7. Children\u2019s book lovers and parents, ages 10 to adult, can attend these free presentations and get an up-close view of titles I\u2019ve chosen after considerable thought. I know for some, choosing a book can be overwhelming. It\u2019s always rewarding to hear people tell me they take the Wilde Award list with them to a bookstore or library and find it a reassuring support as they make their own selections.\nSpeaking of thought, I\u2019m currently preparing the 2017 Wilde Awards for longer books. Be on the lookout for that column next month.\nThe loud Jumperee scares away Cat, Bear and Elephant. Only Mama Frog has the courage to confront and end the Jumperee\u2019s threat. Rhyming cumulative verses conclude with a satisfying surprise.\nPig \u201cwaddley-jogs\u201d off to sleep, but finds cow bedded down in his sty. So begins a string of humorous displacements, fabulous verbs, fun sounds and a join-in refrain that completes read-aloud fun.\nThis singable funny book refreshes the familiar \u201cI Know an Old Lady\u201d tune with flaps, pop-ups, a refrain and an interesting perspective on a hungry anaconda.\nOne word per page and large, graphically-pleasing illustrations will launch discussions about the life cycle of a frog.\nPinkey retells the familiar tale combining the familiar tropes with perfectly paced words and pictures.\nTender-hearted William is cozy in bed but finds a way to \u201cscooch a bit\u201d to make room for five sleepy, chilled animals who join him in a snuggle. There\u2019s counting, word play and engaging refrains in this read-it-again bedtime book.\nBrilliant photographs and a rhyming text describe fall\u2019s beauty.\nCounting and rhyming recount the problem when an inclusive grandmother hosts a huge crowd and a small heroine solves this large problem.\nYoung Jabari wants to jump off the high-dive, but he\u2019s afraid. His caring father counsels, comforts, suggests a positive perspective and celebrates Jabari when he accomplishes his goal.\nA father sensitive to his daughter\u2019s anxiety buys her the colorful cat mask she admires. This cat mask bolsters and restores Lily in situation after situation. Fortenberry excels at wedding word and image as Lily wears the mask to parties with her closest friends (all inanimate) and uses the mask to be invisible at a party.\nAs graduated pages turn, a lonely fish is gobbled by bigger one who is chomped by an even larger fish \u2026 until the 10th fish is devoured, leaving one gigantic lonely fish with a big happy smile. This counting book has bold images, humor and a gentle introduction to food chains.\nRhyming pages describe the many ways seeds become plants. The question-answer format and fold-out pages increase the book\u2019s artistry and child-engagement.\nA soft lyrical story follows the delight of a young boy strolling in the darkening evening and viewing the diversity of his neighborhood. E.B. Godall\u2019s illustrations are stunning.\nSantat uses the structure of the original nursery rhyme to reveal Humpty Dumpty\u2019s emotional first-person narrative as the injured deals with issues that \u201ccouldn\u2019t be healed with bandages and glue.\u201d The book shows the power of a character who faces his fears and flies.\nThe intriguing organization, layered poetic text and dramatic vignettes describe Harriet Tubman as a suffragist, general, spy, nurse who \u201cdreamed of living long enough to one day be old stiff and achy tired and worn and wrinkled and free.\u201d The accompanying illustrations by James Ransome are equally dynamic.\nImagination and playful illustrations show the potential of mistakes to yield amazing artistic opportunities. This is a book to grow children\u2019s confidence and new ways of looking at art.\nThere\u2019s emphasis on the childhood of a thoughtful, problem-solving, gender-conscious young female who grows up to save the NASA\u2019s Apollo 11 mission.\nShawn\u2019s adoration of sharks puts him in direct conflict with a classmate when she lands sharks as her report focus and he has to investigate seals. Negotiation and manipulations end in mutual understanding and friendship.\nAn antidote to anxiety is presenting brave role models. There\u2019s an unstoppable heroine in \u201cCharlotte the Scientist is Squished\u201d by Chapel Hill author Camille Andros. Charlotte, \u201ca serious scientist\u201d (clad in lab coat and goggles), follows the scientific method \u2013 or tries to. The curious bunny is blocked by a den full of family. Brianne Farley\u2019s illustrations add details that contribute to the humor of a story, which is a great way to lead to a discussion of problem solving.\nThe uncertainties of today\u2019s world can be overwhelming. McGhee offers comfort. The unnamed girl worries because \u201cthe news told and told and retold of anger and hatred \u2013 people against people.\u201d Gradually the girl gains confidence to go alone into the world, and her parents muster courage to allow this. The author and illustrator, Pascal Lemaitre, presents huge emotions and abstracts with simplicity that makes them approachable.\nVoice, imagery and rhythms bring alive the dynamism of an enthusiastic boy getting a haircut in a caring barbershop. Bold pictures accent the swagger of the hero\u2019s feelings of royalty.\nSensory imagery and similes combine with close-up photos to show the transformation of eggs to frogs.\nThis book shows the lives of children from Italy, Japan, Peru, Uganda, Russia, India and Iran. Images and words describe their homes, families, clothing, food, transportation, education and more.\nWhen a mouse is swallowed by a wolf, she is surprised to find a roomy, pleasant home established by the duck, a previous meal. Jon Klassen\u2019s illustrations accent the unique quirkiness of this story.\nEdmond Bigsnout, a lone hungry wolf, is fixated on a hunting down a delectable rabbit dinner. Unfortunately (and humorously) a series of ironic twists occur as he enters an unusual apartment building. First, he loses his cooking implements, then his heart to the apartment dwellers.\nA non-fiction text describes the passage of time in the Grand Canyon while fantastical illustrations show a young hiker who travels back in time. Foldout pages and intricate borders add strength to this fiction-nonfiction blend.\nEggers\u2019 \u201cHer Right Foot\u201d begins as a quirky narrative about the Statue of Liberty. Shawn Harris\u2019 bold cut paper and ink illustrations merge with Eggers\u2019 musings, facts, humor and emotions. Together, these trace the story of the gift given by France to the United States for its 100th birthday. Nearing the end, the book\u2019s focus shifts. This 450,000-pound statue who wears Size 879 shoes, herself an immigrant, has welcomed millions to this country. The careful layering and pacing of this book is chilling. It demands re-reading and sharing with others.\nWord and picture romps are great for read-aloud, laugh out-loud fun. The author irreverently, playfully traverses wacky territory from a \u201cone-eyed Orr dripping with gore\u201d to the food complaints of a baby dragon.\nIn her early youth, the young activist imagines having a magic pencil that could change her world. By book\u2019s end, one sees that her writing is that magic. Her journey from dreams to reality has powerful imagery children will relate to.\nNina Simone\u2019s recognized early that the notes of piano represented her world, for she grew up knowing that \u201cWhite was whole.

Castle, born deaf and mute in 1899, was probably also dyslexic and autistic. He spent much of his life locked in silence with only his rich imagination for company.\nThis biography of the famous singer focuses on the power of her work, specifically her courage in performing this intense song about lynching.

        "Filmmaker Kevin Leffler\u2019s first movie, \u201cShooting Michael Moore,\u201d was set to open in Traverse City, Mich., last month, but the screening got canceled at the last minute.\nWas it politically motivated censorship?\nOr simply a prudent safeguard against the possibility of violence against one of Michigan\u2019s own incited by a provocative documentary with an incendiary title?\nMr. Leffler, a Michigan native like his subject, isn\u2019t a director by trade, but he has seen enough of Mr. Moore\u2019s movies to know how a cinematic David can sock it to Goliath.\nSo when Mr. Leffler, a certified public accountant and assistant professor at Baker College, saw inconsistencies between Mr. Moore\u2019s public persona and his actions, he did what the Oscar-winning director himself might do.\nHe picked up a camera and got to work.\n\u201cShooting Michael Moore\u201d contends that the filmmaker treats cast members poorly, rails against corporations such as Halliburton while gobbling up their stock and used his latest film, \u201cSicko,\u201d to paint a highly inaccurate picture of Cuba\u2019s health care system.\nThe movie was shown in Detroit and Miami late last year, but its scheduled Jan. 9 screening at Carmike Cinemas\u2019 Horizon Outlet theater in Traverse City never happened.\nThe cancellation came before a planned Jan. 7 press conference organized by Jeff Gibbs, a longtime friend of Mr. Moore\u2019s, to urge that the screening be stopped.\nMr. Leffler, however, says a viewer would have to invent the last 20 minutes or so of the trip to find the filmmaker\u2019s home if all he had was the film as a guide. Also, he counters, Mr. Moore\u2019s address is on public record. Anyone could find it.\nMr. Leffler says he never said the title implies violence toward Mr. Moore but that people can interpret it as they please. He also points out that in Mr. Moore\u2019s book \u201cDownsize This!\u201d he calls for an anniversary riot to mark the 1992 Los Angeles riots, going so far as to include a hand-drawn map to the affluent Beverly Hills neighborhood intended as the riot\u2019s starting point. Mr. Moore does advise readers to burn the neighborhood, not the neighbors.\nThe fledgling filmmaker also says he\u2019s open to changing the film\u2019s title, although no final decision has been made.\nMr. Moore did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article, and Carmike Cinemas did not return four calls for comment. Carmike Director of Marketing Dale Hurst told the Record-Eagle last month he had \u201cno idea\u201d why his company decided not to show the movie.\nThe National Association of Theatre Owners does not comment on the actions of its members.\nMr. Leffler poured $175,000 of his own cash into the project, which he began shooting in 2004. A version of the film played at the 2007 Flint Film Festival in Michigan, walking off with the Audience Choice Award.\nHe got an infusion of funding after a rough cut of the film that aired on C-SPAN attracted a backer. He used the additional cash to film new material for the project \u2014 scenes rebutting Mr. Moore\u2019s celebration of the Cuban health care model in \u201cSicko.\u201d He got that new material by picking up the phone book and cold-calling doctors in the Miami area to find some who had practiced medicine in Cuba.\nMr. Leffler says his movie \u2014 which played four weeks at an AMC movie theater in Miami and two weeks in several Detroit theaters \u2014 could hit theaters in New York City and Los Angeles early in March, although nothing is confirmed yet.\nMr. Leffler, who went to high school with Mr. Moore and later worked with him at a local crisis hot line, swears he\u2019s not grinding an ideological ax. He says he\u2019s a registered Democrat who recently voted for President Obama. It\u2019s just that he can\u2019t stomach what he sees as Mr. Moore\u2019s hypocrisy.\n\u201cHere you have one of the loudest proponents of free speech, but when it\u2019s against him, he\u2019s happy to censor it,\u201d he says.",

        "The Land of Lincoln was the focus of a river cruise on the American Duchess paddle-wheeler that traversed almost the entire length of the Illinois River in August.\nThe Illinois River isn\u2019t exactly top of mind when it comes to recreational river cruises, a pursuit that conjures up far-flung locations like the Danube, Nile and Amazon. But the nearly 275-mile-long waterway that threads through the heart of the Prairie State served as the main setting for a groundbreaking \u2014 make that waterbreaking? \u2014 cruise this past summer. That\u2019s when the 166-passenger American Duchess paddle-wheeler made its way from the Mississippi River town of Alton, up to Ottawa, on the Illinois.\nI witnessed that excitement firsthand in August on the ship\u2019s inaugural trip along the Illinois River, a route typically populated by commercial barges and smaller pleasure boats. Tagging along was my 13-year-old niece, Sara, a good half-century younger than most of the passengers.\nDuring our deep dive into the Land of Lincoln, the year-old Duchess made maiden calls at several ports, including Peoria, whose riverfront bustled with a Saturday morning farmers market, and the sleepier town of Havana, where the mayor, a Dixieland jazz band and camera-toting residents turned out to greet the Victorian-style vessel as she cozied up to shore.\nIn these parts, the Duchess was a bona fide aquatic anomaly. The limited-but-growing inventory of overnight cruise boats plying U.S. rivers tends to cluster on bigger, better-known waterways. And many of these ships simply aren\u2019t a good fit for the Illinois River, a tributary of the Mississippi that basically flows southwest of Joliet, at the confluence of the Kankakee and Des Plaines rivers, all the way down to Grafton, not too far north of St. Louis. The vessels are often too tall to navigate the northern reaches of the Illinois; in the game of limbo between the boat and some of the low-slung bridges that straddle the water, the boat loses.\nEven the relatively compact Duchess had to collapse its black smokestacks and sun-deck umbrellas to squeeze under spans carrying trains and trucks roaring overhead. If heavy rain had caused water levels to rise too much, that would have been the end of our river road.\nCruise companies are willing to tackle these kinds of logistical headaches if it means giving the growing riverboat market new and off-the-beaten-path itineraries like this one, dubbed \u201cLincoln\u2019s Illinois.\u201d By venturing deeper into domestic waterways, they\u2019re catering to a clientele that craves the intimacy of riverboat cruising but doesn\u2019t necessarily want to fly to a foreign country to experience it. They\u2019re targeting folks who are eager for longer, overnight journeys on U.S. rivers but have already \u201cdone\u201d the Mississippi or the Columbia and Snake rivers in the Pacific Northwest.\nJust about everyone I talked to aboard the Duchess \u2014 one of three paddle-wheelers owned by American Queen Steamboat Co., which has a fourth on the way \u2014 had previously traveled with the New Albany, Ind.-based riverboat cruise line. They\u2019d usually cruised some stretch of the Mississippi \u2014 the Memphis-New Orleans leg is especially popular \u2014 and they\u2019d usually done it on the company\u2019s largest vessel, the 436-passenger American Queen.\nHere\u2019s something different: seeing Abraham Lincoln in a bright orange life jacket during the ship\u2019s mandatory muster drill.\nAbraham Lincoln, played by Freeport resident George Buss, waves as the boat pulls away from Hannibal, Mo.\nThe country\u2019s esteemed POTUS, played with haunting perfection by Freeport resident and Lincoln impersonator George Buss, traveled onboard with us for most of the voyage. He and Mary Todd (Buss\u2019 actual wife) would pop up in various spots around the boat, making small talk with passengers and delivering snack-sized doses of history in keeping with the trip\u2019s Lincoln theme. When we ran into Honest Abe one sunny afternoon on the top deck, he pulled out a copy of the Gettysburg Address from his stovepipe hat and gave it to my niece.\nIt was a little head-trippy to think that nearly two centuries ago, the real Lincoln worked on this very waterway, piloting a flatboat full of supplies headed for New Orleans.\nThe towns that bookended our cruise hosted the first and last of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, a series of verbal smackdowns that started in Ottawa and ended a few months later in Alton.\nNot surprisingly, the cruise\u2019s shore excursions often featured a tie-in to the 16th president, whether it be one of the stops on the ship\u2019s private hop-on, hop-off buses that take passengers on a continuous sightseeing circuit in every port, or something more elaborate, like the \u201cpremium excursion\u201d (read: extra cost) that shuttled us from Havana to Springfield for the day. On that one, we logged a lot of Lincoln: a visit to his presidential museum, a tour of the only home he ever owned, a stop at his tomb and a trip to nearby New Salem, a re-creation of the village where Lincoln lived in the 1830s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a field trip!\u201d Sara said on our motor coach ride to the state capital.\nSara, about to enter eighth grade, was the only kid on the cruise. Heck, at 49 years old, even I felt like a kid. The average age of American Queen Steamboat Co. passengers is about 72, according to company officials. Shave a decade off that for customers on its American Empress boat based in the Pacific Northwest.\n\u201cThis is how old people have fun,\u201d an energetic septuagenarian stage-whispered to my niece as her smiling husband grabbed her hand and led her onto the ship\u2019s dance floor. The band jammed out show tunes and other well-known hits while the enthusiastic crowd clapped along.\nShe didn\u2019t have a ship\u2019s kids club to retreat to, or other tweens and teens to play with. But plenty of passengers stepped up to fill the social void, taking on the role of de facto grandparents, showering her with warm smiles and conversation.\nA retired Florida couple even invited us to a pre-dinner cocktail party in their swanky loft suite, a 550-square-foot, two-story space with a private balcony \u2014 roughly three times the size of our interior stateroom.\nThe butler doted on Sara, making sure her wine glass was full of Sprite.\n\u201cOld people are nice,\u201d Sara later declared.\nHigh ceilings and soaring windows in the Duchess' dining room give passengers a good view of the outdoors.\nWe both relished the semiformal fun of our nightly ritual: eating a multicourse meal in the Duchess\u2019 elegant, high-ceilinged dining room. The expansive windows were like a movie screen, showing an endless loop of scenery as diners dug into filet mignon, grilled salmon, fettuccine Alfredo, lobster tails, etc.\nUnlike on some cruises, Duchess passengers don\u2019t have to eat at the same time, same table. We could show up whenever we wanted between 5:30 and 8 p.m., either opting for a table for two or, if we were feeling more social, joining others who felt the same.\nFor our post-show dessert, we\u2019d swing by the boat\u2019s self-service Perks cafe to rustle up an ice cream sundae we\u2019d eat on the top deck, under the stars.\nThe 340-foot-long Duchess isn\u2019t big by cruise-ship standards, but it\u2019s outfitted with a lot of the amenities you\u2019d expect in larger vessels: a show lounge, a fitness center, multiple venues to eat and drink.\nOne thing it doesn\u2019t have is a casino, which is kind of ironic given the boat\u2019s origin. The hull used to belong to the Isle of Capri riverboat casino, a longtime fixture in the Quad Cities. American Queen Steamboat Co. bought it in 2016, transforming it into a boutique riverboat reminiscent of a white wedding cake. The old-fashioned gingerbread trim on the outside belies a more modern interior with contemporary furniture and art.\nA daily newsletter was dropped off in our cabin each night, per cruise ship protocol. The \u201cRiver Times\u201d detailed the next day\u2019s port and a schedule of onboard activities, so you\u2019d know when to catch a game of bingo or trivia in the Lincoln Library or an educational talk by the so-called Riverlorian, the ship\u2019s resident culture and history expert.\nDespite its relatively snug size, the Duchess never felt crowded. While most passengers gravitated to the rocking chairs on the second and third decks or loitered over coffee at the River Club Terrace at the back of the boat, Sara and I preferred camping out on the couches on the top of the ship\u2019s sprawling sun deck \u2014 a place we had virtually to ourselves. We used the boat\u2019s binoculars to spot bald eagles and watch startled Asian carp shoot out of the water as motorboats zoomed by.\nAt port, getting on and off the ship was quick and easy. We were usually met with some kind of surprise as we disembarked.\nIn the small town of Grafton, the surprise was a delicious one: crates full of free, perfectly ripe peaches plucked in Calhoun County.\nA Grafton alderman joined us on one of the ship\u2019s hop-on, hop-off buses, filling us in on the history of the town, a place hit particularly hard by the devastating floods of 1993.\nGrafton sits at the mouth of the Illinois River, where it empties into the Mississippi. It was bumpin\u2019 back in the steamboat era. The port once teemed with passengers headed to St. Louis or St. Paul on the Mississippi or making their way to Peoria on the Illinois. The fishing and boat-building industries were booming.\nThese days, fewer than 700 people call Grafton home. The harbor has reinvented itself as the \u201cKey West to the Midwest,\u201d a summer playground for boaters and bar-hoppers.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many people pour in on the weekends,\u201d the alderman said.\nOn our Tuesday morning visit, Grafton wasn\u2019t in party mode. Sara and I strolled along the quiet main drag, ducking into a few artsy boutiques and antique shops.\nWe decided to hop back on the hop-on bus for a ride to Illinois\u2019 largest state park: Pere Marquette. Measuring more than 8,000 acres, the park has one of those imposing limestone and timber lodges built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Depression. We only had time for a short but worthwhile hike up to one of Pere Marquette\u2019s many Native American burial mounds before it was anchors aweigh.\nWe had more time to explore at the only non-Illinois port of the cruise: Mark Twain\u2019s hometown of Hannibal, Mo., a stop that entailed gliding along the Mississippi River before backtracking to the base of the Illinois.\nIn Hannibal, the surprise waiting for us at the dock was a young boy and girl dressed as Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher, foreshadowing a day that would be chock-full of Mark Twain.\nSara and I borrowed a couple of the ship\u2019s bikes \u2014 a nice amenity \u2014 and pedaled to the nearby Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum.\nWe hoofed it up a bunch of stairs to the Mark Twain Memorial Lighthouse.\nWe ate fried chicken and homemade root beer at the Mark Twain Dinette and poked our heads in the riverfront brewery named \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Mark Twain Brewing Co.\nThe hop-on, hop-off bus took us to the Mark Twain Cave, a chilly labyrinth featured in several of the author\u2019s books.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you glad I made you read \u2018Huck Finn\u2019 and \u2018Tom Sawyer\u2019 before the trip?\u201d I asked in Wise Aunt voice.\nNow it was Sara\u2019s turn to be appalled.\nMigrating American white pelicans crowd a green swath of land on the Illinois River north of Peoria.\nThe Mississippi River stretch of the journey is where our boat passed through the most locks. Going through locks, much like squeezing under low bridges, adds a jolt of excitement to river travel.\nWhen we pulled up to these engineering feats, passengers lined the deck\u2019s rails as the Duchess oh-so-gently maneuvered into its cement chute. A gate closed behind us, allowing the water level to rise or fall as needed before another barrier opened, sending us on our way.\nWe took these \u201cwater stairs\u201d nine times over the course of the cruise, a voyage that led us past steep limestone bluffs and forests of leafy trees that made me wish it were autumn, not August. Peaceful. Tranquil. That\u2019s how I can best describe the sensation of sitting on the sun deck, cruising at a leisurely 5 to 6 mph, with a soundtrack supplied by chirping cicadas and the gentle hum of the engine.\nI liked watching the wildlife, wondering if that heron hopscotching alongside us was being curious or territorial, trying to run our giant wedding cake out of town.\nIt felt like a mashup of Ireland and the Everglades as we passed an emerald green island full of migrating American white pelicans.\nAround the bend, a couple of fawns ventured to the water\u2019s edge before darting back into the brush.\nA rainbow shimmered in the blue sky as we pulled out of Havana.\nNear the end of our journey, we cruised by Starved Rock State Park, getting a stellar view of its namesake sandstone butte.\nThat\u2019s the scenic highlight reel, mind you. During seven days on the water, we meandered through some mundane stretches too. Nature\u2019s splendor was often interrupted by manmade inventions designed to quarry limestone, store grain and transport goods from Point A to Point B. Yet from the water, even these prosaic fixtures exuded a certain heartland charm.\nThe Illinois River will never be flanked by the grand cathedrals and castles of Europe, the pyramids of Egypt or the rainforests of the Amazon. But a row of towering silos at sunset has a homespun beauty of its own, at least to this Midwestern girl.\nAMERICAN QUEEN STEAMBOAT CO.: The riverboat cruise line has a trio of paddle-wheelers offering a range of overnight cruises on U.S. rivers. The American Duchess and American Queen operate year-round, traveling the Mississippi, as well as the Ohio, Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. The American Empress sails in the Pacific Northwest, March through November.

        "The defendant said he had had three or four pints at a family Christening.\nA suspected drink-driver failed to give a police station breath test after a Christening, but had no medical excuse, a court heard.\nDad-of-one Anthony Fitzpatrick (34) was caught on Skipton Road in Colne because he was in his works van which had been reported stolen. It had been found, the police had been informed, and an officer who decided to make a check on it thought Fitzpatrick smelled of alcohol.\nBurnley magistrates were told how ground-worker Fitzpatrick was arrested after he blew 85 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath at the roadside. The legal limit is 35. He had a record for drink driving.\nThe defendant, who formerly had a drink problem, told the probation service he had had three or four pints at a family Christening before he got behind the wheel.\nMiss Parveen Akhtar, prosecuting, said Fitzpatrick was requested to provide a breath sample at the police station. She continued: \"He failed to provide a sample and failed to provide any medical reason as to why.\"\nMr Daniel Frazer, defending Fitzpatrick, said the van, owned by his boss, had been reported as stolen but had been found and recovered.\nThe solicitor continued: \"The police officer in this particular case saw the van being driven. He did a PNC check and realised it had been reported stolen and had been reported found again.\"\nMr Frazer said when the defendant was taken into custody, he requested to speak to a solicitor and was refused by the police until the procedure had taken place. The solicitor said: \"He was somewhat misguided as he believed he was able to speak to a solicitor before the sample was taken. He can do no more than plead guilty and ask for full credit from the courts.\"\nFitzpatrick, of Union Street in Colne, admitted failing to provide a specimen for analysis and having no insurance on November 4th.\nHe was given a community order with a nine-month alcohol treatment requirement and was told to pay \u00a3220 in fines, costs and victim surcharge.

        "Most ski and snowboard instructors do a lot more than teach.\nSometimes they teach beginners, and sometimes they guide more advanced athletes who just want a fun day on the hill. They share their knowledge about preventing injury, activities in the valley and competition and often form relationships with clients that last for years.\nNow, a group of local pros is trying to apply that teaching model throughout the year. Pros in Motion, a business based in the Roaring Fork Valley, contracts ski and snowboard pros to give clients that all-around experience while they\u2019re recreating in other sports, particularly cycling.\nPros in Motion works with everyone from kids and older athletes just learning how to ride a bike to more advanced cyclists who want to explore the valley.\nPros in Motion was created almost by accident when Kasin started riding with his ski clients. Kasin was racing bikes at the highest level for amateurs when he had a heart attack at age 41. After recovering, Kasin was still training, albeit not at the same level.\nThat person has become one of Kasin\u2019s favorite ski clients, he said.\nKasin has since formalized the program, booking clients with pros who match their skill sets and availability. Pros in Motion operates independently, but it partners with the Viceroy in Snowmass Village and The Little Nell and the Limelight in Aspen, running cycling adventures out of the hotels.\n\u201cNow we\u2019ve gotten to the point where we\u2019re training our pros, we\u2019re choosing our pros based on a common set of goals and a way of approaching the guest and treating the guest,\u201d Kasin said.\nDaRosa rode with a family from New York City that was in town right before the start of the USA Pro Challenge. DaRosa started off with the father, taking him over some of the race route, and then he asked DaRosa to take his family out for an afternoon.\nThe clients were flying back before the race actually kicked off, but they joined DaRosa for the opening ceremonies on Aug. 17 in Snowmass Base Village.\nHealth and safety are also important facets to what the pros do, including nutrition and hydration tips as well as sharing Kasin\u2019s knowledge of cardiac health. All the pros are CPR and AED certified, and some have had some first-responder or mountain-rescue training.\nKasin wants to give locals and others who haven\u2019t ridden with the group yet a chance to participate with a four-day event later this month. One day each will be dedicated to leading people over the Pro Challenge Stage 1 route and up and down Independence Pass. The pros will lead groups on a tour of the Roaring Fork Valley another day and a double stage of the Maroon Bells and Castle Creek Road on the last day.\nKasin is planning the tour for the weekend of Sept. 22 and 23. He said athletes can participate in two or more days, stretched out over two different weekends or four days in a row. Groups will be broken out by skill level.\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a different dimension to riding in the fall versus the summer, and we want to share that with everyone,\u201d Kasin said.\nTheir work doesn\u2019t stop there. The pros are continuing to help people train for events throughout the fall, including the Rally the Valley race on Sept. 21 in Glenwood Springs and El Tour de Tucson on Nov. 23. The pros also help people train for ski season.",

A hijacked truck was driven into a crowd of pedestrians and crashed into the department store on Friday in the Swedish capital.\nTens of thousands of Swedes turned out in Stockholm Sunday for what they called a \"lovefest\" after Friday's terrorist truck attack killed four people and injured 15.\nA 39-year-old Uzbek believed to have extremist sympathies is under arrest for allegedly ramming a stolen truck into a crowd at the Ahlens department store.\n\"Fear shall not reign. Terror cannot win,\" Mayor Karin Wanngard told a crowd estimated at 50,000.\nOne woman held a poster reading: \"We don't respond with fear, we respond with love.\"\nFriday's attack apparently had little effect on liberal Sweden's global reputation as an open and welcoming society.\nOne participant at Sunday's rally told the Associated Press that the fact the suspect is a refugee means nothing.\n\"This is a sick individual and has nothing to do with his refugee status. I think most Stockholmians realize that just because you are a refugee or a Muslim doesn't mean you are a terrorist.\"\nCandles and flowers placed in central Stockholm to commemorate the victims of last Friday's terror attack in the city, in Stockholm, Sweden, April 9, 2017.\nPolice arrested the Uzbek-born suspect hours after the truck attack. He was known to intelligence services since last year when he disappeared before he could be deported after his application for asylum was rejected. Authorities knew he had pro-extremist sympathies.\nBut no group has claimed responsibility for Friday's attack and no motive is known.\nPolice say they have arrested a second person in connection with the attack, but have given no further information.\nPhotos taken at the scene Friday showed the vehicle was a truck belonging to beer maker Spendrups, which said its truck had been hijacked earlier in the day.\nWitnesses say the truck drove straight into the entrance of the Ahlens Department Store on Drottninggatan, the city's biggest pedestrian street, sending shoppers screaming and running.

        "Yemeni men stand at the back of an armed pick in the capital Sanaa on December 19, 2018.\nThe Arab Coalition bombed an air base in Yemen\u2019s rebel-held capital on Wednesday to prevent a terror attack on its forces by the Houthi militia.\nIn comments aired by Saudi state-run TV, the coalition said it struck the air base next to Sanaa's international airport, destroying a rocket launcher and a drone that it said was preparing to carry out an attack.\nThe coalition said the Houthis are using the airport \"as a military camp in violation of international humanitarian law\".\nThe comments came as a ceasefire around the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah largely held on Wednesday.\nReopening Sanaa airport was among key issues discussed in peace talks in Sweden earlier this month, but the warring parties did not make progress on the topic.\nOne proposal from the rebels was for Sanaa-bound aircraft to stop at another city in the region for inspection before proceeding to the Yemeni capital. The internationally recognised government proposed that Sanaa-bound aircraft be inspected in the southern port city of Aden.\nMore discussions on the airport are expected in the next round of peace talks in January.\nAlso on Wednesday, the Yemeni government appointed three military commanders as representatives to a UN-organised committee set to monitor the ceasefire in Hodeidah.\nMembers of the Houthi group and UN mission to Yemen will join the government representatives to oversee the withdrawal of armed forces from the port city, a military source told The National.\nBrig Sagheer Aziz, Brig Mohamed Eidha and Maj Gen Ahmed Al Kukabani attended the first meeting for the Redeployment Co-ordination Committee on Wednesday. The Houthis have yet to name their representatives.\nThe committee will be given two weeks to organise the complete withdrawal of armed forces.\nMartin Griffiths, the UN envoy to Yemen, said \u201cneutral forces\u201d would be given the task of maintaining security in the country\u2019s biggest port, through which more than 70 per cent of aid enters a country with 14 million people on the brink of famine.\nHodeidah\u2019s deputy mayor, Waleed Al Qudaimi, said the Houthis shelled pro-government forces on the outskirts of the city.\nThe Houthis claimed government forces were bombing rebel camps east of the airport and within the University of Hodeidah.\nCol Withah Al Dubaish, spokesman of the Giant Brigade, a southern faction aligned with the Yemeni government, told The National that his forces would not stand and watch as the Houthis breached the ceasefire.\n\"Our forces will stay highly equipped. We are ready to inflict a fatal blow on them and finalise taking over the city and the ports in case the Houthis continue to break the ceasefire,\u201d Col Al Dubaish said.\nThe Giant Brigade has suspended all military operations but remain within striking distance of Hodeidah port.\n\u201cWe stopped to give a chance for the international community to implement the political resolution, otherwise our response will be tough and strict, in case the Houthis keep playing their dirty game inside the city,\" Col Al Dubaish said.\nSouth of Hodeidah city, the Houthis reportedly shelled residences and attacked the market in the populated city of Hays. More than 80 per cent of Hodeidah\u2019s 650,000 residents have fled and settled in the surrounding areas, fearing renewed violence.\nMany regard the recent clashes as a precursor to a breakdown in the political solution. Raed Shayef, a journalist working in Yemen, expects the ceasefire to break down within days.\n\u201cThe Houthis are using this as an opportunity to muster their forces and then they will return to fighting. They would not accept handing over the city because that will cut them off their main supply route,\u201d Mr Shayef said.\nDespite the turbulent ceasefire, Yemeni military in the interim capital of Aden remain hopeful for a peaceful resolution to a war that has claimed thousands of lives and triggered the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster.\nCol Mohammed Hizam of the Yemeni army said the truce provided the Houthis with their only chance of survival.\n\"I am sure the ceasefire will be achieved because the Houthis see that it will save them because they can\u2019t fight any more.

        "The House of Representatives voted Thursday for a controversial bill to allow luxury Tesla cars to be sold directly to consumers and outside the traditional dealership system in Connecticut.\nThe bipartisan bill passed 116-32, with three members absent, as seven Democrats joined with 25 Republicans against the measure.\nProponents say that Tesla is a groundbreaking company with state-of-the-art technology for electric-only cars, but opponents said it is not fair to change the rules for only one car company.\nRep. Tony Guerrera, the co-chairman of the legislature's transportation committee, said that if the bill receives final approval, Tesla will be authorized to operate three stores to sell directly to customers throughout the state. Tesla is expected to create 25 to 75 jobs in Connecticut if those stores are opened. The high-performance, luxury cars are manufactured in California and can range in price from $70,000 to $140,000.\nThe bill was crafted to apply only to Tesla. The measure applies to companies that manufacture only electric cars, have no franchise agreements with any car dealer and sell only the cars that it manufactures.\nThe measure still requires approval by the Senate and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy.\nAn earlier version of the bill provided for five stores, but the compromise bill passed by the House on Thursday dropped that figure to three.\nRep. Thomas O'Dea, a New Canaan Republican who serves as the ranking member on the transportation committee, said he had \"gone full circle\" on the revised bill and has now become a supporter.\nThe dealerships lobbied heavily against the bill at the start of the session. In February, former state Sen. James Fleming, the president of the Connecticut Automotive Retailers Association, blasted the bill in front of the transportation committee.\n\"Granting Tesla a corporate loophole is a risky business and will circumvent long-standing consumer protections and jeopardize local businesses that have operated under these laws in good faith for over 40 years,\" Fleming said in his testimony.\nTesla lost $65 million in 2013, and the company is still not profitable, Fleming said. The company's chief executive officer, Elon Musk, has been quoted as saying that Tesla's first profitable year could be 2020.\nFleming says the Tesla cars are so expensive that only the richest citizens can purchase them.\n\"If Tesla folds tomorrow, there will be a few hundred people in Connecticut very disappointed, but the holders of most of these cars are your wealthiest 1 percent, and this is typically their third or fourth car,'' Fleming testified.\nThe automobile dealers, however, said Thursday that the situation had changed since Fleming's initial testimony. Fleming thanked legislators Thursday for the compromise, noting that Tesla will be limited to three retail outlets. In addition, Tesla will be required to comply with all motor vehicle and consumer protection laws.\nTesla hailed the House's passage on Thursday, saying it would help bring jobs to Connecticut. Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla's vice president for business development, said, \"We've worked with the dealers association, made compromises and now look forward to the Senate also recognizing that Tesla can bring revenue, ingenuity, and consumer choice to the state.\"\nBut Rep. Rob Sampson, a conservative Republican from Wolcott, said, \"This bill is a symptom of everything that is wrong with government. ... We're showing the world that we can change the rules for anyone\" that lobbies the measure.\nHe added, \"This bill is entirely against every principle that I stand for. ... This is crony capitalism.\"",
        "Carroll County residents loudly told their legislative delegation yesterday that they do not want to rush the creation of a county police department and they want the matter to go to referendum.\nMany criticized the county commissioners' decision in October to create a county police force and to give themselves the power to appoint its chief.\n\"The commissioners are really wrong on this point, and I ask that they change their minds,\" said Harold Forney, a county resident who was among about 200 people gathered for a 2 1/2 -hour hearing on the topic. \"This centralizes law enforcement under the commissioners. What the county commissioners desire to do is take away that watchdog.\"\nThe decision to create the county force came after years of discussion about abolishing the resident trooper program, which has been based at the state police barracks in Westminster.\nThe resident troopers have been the county's primary law enforcement for more than 30 years. But change has become necessary as Carroll County's population has swelled to about 170,000.\nEven before the public hearing began, state Sen. Larry E. Haines won applause for voicing concerns about the timing of creating a police department.\n\"Have the commissioners even discussed that maybe this is an issue to go to public referendum?\" he asked. \"I don't see the need to rush this thing going through for July 1. I think we're moving too fast.\"\nThe delegation is expected to make a decision this week on this and other topics discussed at yesterday's hearing.\nA 10 a.m. public hearing planned for Jan. 31 may be rescheduled to a time that is more convenient for working residents, following a suggestion made yesterday, a county official said.\n\"The Maryland State Police are no longer the best bang for the buck for Carroll County,\" said Steven D. Powell, the county chief of staff. \"This has been a long debate. This has not been a quick issue.\"\nThere is agreement that the resident trooper program is not a long-term solution for growing Carroll County, he said.\nEliminating the trooper program would save $1 million annually, according to county officials. The sheriff's department would remain in place.\n\"There is no appreciable difference between the cost to run a future unified sheriff's department and the cost to operate a county police department,\" Powell said.\nSheriff Kenneth L. Tregoning said he has urged county commissioners for 21 years to create a law enforcement master plan, which has not been done. Suddenly there is a sense of urgency to get somewhere without any plan in place, he said.\nFor several years, he has pushed for his department to assume primary responsibility for law enforcement in the county.\n\"There is no sound reason that the county is going forward at this speedy and reckless pace to dismantle the sheriff's department,\" Tregoning said.\n\"Here they want to change the entire face of law enforcement, and they have not had one public meeting. I find that disgraceful,\" he said.\nTregoning urged a longer transition period that allows for phasing in the changes rather than compressing them into the remaining months before July.\nCarroll County Sheriff's Lt. John H. Shippee said a combined communication system would help the various law enforcement agencies talk to each other .\nFive of the county's eight municipalities - Westminster, Taneytown, Hampstead, Manchester and Sykesville - have their own police departments.\nAmong Shippee's concerns about the proposed county police department are the cost to taxpayers, the fact that the commissioners would get to appoint the head law enforcement officer and the impact on the sheriff's department, he said in a later interview.\n\"I absolutely oppose the county police department,\" he said.\nEven if he and other members of the sheriff's department were hired for the new police force - as they have been told they would be - they would be guaranteed their same salaries but not necessarily their rank or duty assignment, he said.\nSome residents say they simply want to feel part of the decision process when it comes to their safety.\n\"As a taxpayer, I'm concerned about how this is going to raise our taxes,\" Westminster resident Cheryl Powers said. \"Since we're one of the highest counties as far as taxes and one of the lowest as far as crime rate, I'm wondering why we're talking about going to this new county force. I urge it to go to referendum, just because I think the people need a say in this.\"",
        "Having been watching the Rocks since 1994 I\u2019ve grown up with the Bognor Way. Fast, expansive football from the back to the front which has given years of excitement \u2013 with many highlights along the way, from Peterborough to Grimsby, writes Ian Guppy, chairman of the Rocks supporters\u2019 club.\nWe\u2019ve always been known for the way we play the beautiful game and our reputation is known through non-league circles.\nLast season we were spoiled with excitement building to a pulsating play-off final win versus Dulwich with goals that epitomised the Bognor Way, aided by style and pace.\nThis season started similarly with exciting games v Bath, Poole, Welling and Whitehawk. We were undefeated in the first five games with the Bognor Way shining through.\nThem the results dried up and wins became hard to come by, yet the same story rang true from almost every single game. When I was asked \u201cHow did Bognor play?\u201d I\u2019d reply: \u201cWe lost, we played really well, had lots of possession, made a few mistakes and were punished.\u201d That\u2019s been the story for almost every single game and it\u2019s been hard to swallow.\nIt\u2019s taken all season for someone to describe things perfectly. So many sides we\u2019ve faced this season have set up all similarly and most are near the top. Havant, Hampton, Hemel Hempstead, Truro, Braintree, to name a few, have the same standard of two very strong defenders who \u2018bully\u2019 the opposition, two quick, clinical strikers who punish mistakes and pacy wingers who can punish errors.\nAt this level the punishment is brutal and that has been the hardest thing to adapt to. It\u2019s testament to our style that Poole tweeted this week to say they couldn\u2019t believe our league position following the way we played against them in the opening week \u2013 they stated we were one of the best footballing sides they\u2019d played all season.\nOne criticism has been that we have no plan B and players in our squad are all similar, so to change our style is hard. I\u2019m not in any way saying other clubs in our league are all \u2018kick and run\u2019 but their strength leads to them being able to adapt.\nSalford City came into the National North this season and have changed their style to gain promotion to the National League. Yes they have the finances and location but they\u2019ve looked at the league they\u2019re in and adapted; the same can be said for Havant.\nThis season\u2019s experience can strengthen us, but we have to see that took us (fans and players) a good few months to suss out this league.\nIf we can learn, we can come back stronger than ever thanks to the superb work that has been done off the field this season.",
        "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The head of the International Monetary Fund warned Wednesday that leading nations need to embrace bold policy steps to accelerate a still-modest and fragile global economic recovery.\nIMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that as the world still struggles to emerge from the 2008 financial crisis, economies are under threat from tensions involving Ukraine and Russia to inaction in countries that should be driving growth.\nLagarde said the European Central Bank, for example, should consider lowering interest rates further and using unconventional policies to support growth and fight inflation that is too low.\nHer comments came in a speech previewing next week's meetings of global finance officials in Washington. The 188-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank, will hold their spring policy meetings.\nIn advance of those weekend discussions, finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 leading economic powers will also meet. The United States will be represented by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.\nIn her remarks, Lagarde noted that the G-20 finance officials in a February meeting in Australia had committed to pursuing policies that would boost global GDP by more than $2 trillion over the coming five years.\nLagarde said if the G-20 countries can do so, it would \"place the global economy on a substantially different and better trajectory from today.\"\nLagarde said she thinks the global economy is turning the corner from the Great Recession of 2007-2009, but she said overall growth remains too slow and weak.\nShe warned that the recovery could be put at risk by the wrong policy decisions and by rising geopolitical tensions.\n\"The situation in Ukraine is one which, if not well managed, could have broader spillover effects,\" Lagarde said. \"Unless countries come together to take the right kind of policy measures, we could be facing years of slow and sub-par growth, well below the solid, sustainable growth that is needed to create enough jobs and improving living standards in the future.\"\nShe noted that among major industrial countries, growth is strongest in the United States. But she said it would be critical for the Fed to \"carefully manage the gradual withdrawal\" of its support for growth.\nThe Fed last month approved a third reduction in its monthly bond purchases, which have been aimed at keeping long-term rates low. This week, Yellen said she thought a key short-term rate would need to remain low for a considerable period to bolster growth.\nLagarde said Europe's central bank, which handles rate policies for countries that use the euro currency, should further lower rates to make sure extremely low inflation doesn't hold back economic growth.\nShe also called on Japan, the world's third-largest economy, to pursue structural reforms for its economy to help lift the country from two decades of sub-par growth.\nIn emerging markets, Lagarde said there's a risk of heightened market volatility associated with the moves by the Fed to cut back on bond purchases. The U.S. effort, by increasing rates in America, could trigger flows of capital out of emerging market countries \u2014 something that resulted in a period of market volatility last year.\n\"Countries with weaker fundamentals ... are likely to be more affected,\" Lagarde said, urging nations with high budget and trade deficits to work to close those gaps.",
        "Australian Paper will push ahead with a plan to burn municipal waste to generate electricity for its Maryvale paper mill, projected to support more than 900 jobs when it is operational.\nAustralian Paper announced it would partner with French-based company SUEZ to develop the $600 million project after an 18-month, $7.5-million feasibility study found the facility would \"operate at a high efficiency\".\nWhile construction is not expected to begin until at least early 2020, a recent economic impact study projected the facility could support more than 1000 jobs a year during the three-year construction period in addition to ongoing jobs when the plant is operational.\nWith experience managing 55 similar facilities across the globe, SUEZ will oversee the construction and operation of the plant.\nThe Environment Protection Authority approved Australian Paper's application for the project in November last year and the company has also been granted a planning permit by Latrobe City Council.\nThe Energy from Waste facility is expected to divert about 650,000 tonnes of residual waste from Melbourne and Gippsland landfill and return up to four petajoules of natural gas and 30 megawatt-hours an hour of electricity to the state's energy market.\nHowever, Australian Paper general manager of communications Craig Dunn said the next challenge for the project would be to secure waste contracts and that the company would be participating in tender processes this year.\n\"We do need to secure waste contracts \u2013 we're hoping to achieve that goal by early 2020 when we need to finalise our financial arrangements,\" he said.\nAustralian Paper will seek external funding \"from the market\" to finance the facility.\nWith such huge employment opportunities in the wake of the closure of Hazelwood Power Station in 2017, which left 450 employees and 300 contractors without a job, Mr Dunn said \"one of the advantages\" of constructing the facility in the Latrobe Valley was \"access to a skilled workforce\".\n\"We see an excellent fit between the skills required and the community,\" he said.\nGippsland Trades and Labour Council secretary Steve Dodd welcomed the facility as a \"shot in the arm for the economy and the Latrobe Valley\".\nThe GTLC, which has been working to up-skill Latrobe Valley workers since the closure of Hazelwood, will meet with Australian Paper and SUEZ to find out exactly what skills and qualifications local workers would have to obtain to secure employment at the facility.\nMr Dodd said the roles at the facility would include \"some generic skills and some specialised skills\", however, was confident the \"highly skilled\" Latrobe Valley workforce would be \"capable of picking up those jobs\".\n\"We'll be providing that training or helping people get ready for that training,\" he said.\nWhile Mr Dodd said the region had been frustrated by unfulfilled promises of other job-creating projects over the years, he was confident the energy from waste facility would \"turn into jobs for people in the region\".\n\"I have no doubt that it will be great for the Latrobe Valley,\" he said.\nFor Latrobe City mayor Graeme Middlemiss, the energy from waste project would \"underpin the future of paper mill\" and \"guarantee Latrobe Valley jobs into the future\".\n\"The big issue facing the mill was the rapidly increasing price gas, which threatened to make operations at Maryvale mill economically unviable,\" he said.\n\"We are therefore totally supportive of an alternative power supply which will secure the future of the plant.\n\"The key is to guarantee current jobs into the future.\"\nThe mayor said council would be \"insisting\" emission controls and emission limits are strictly in place, however, said all information presented to council indicated emissions would be \"very limited and contained within the existing buffer zone\".",

        "Global polling and research firm, YouGov, has released its 2015 Best Brand Australia ranking, with Google nabbing the top spot.\nThis is the first time the poll has been conducted in Australia, with a buzz rankings chart that shows the brands with the highest average buzz scores between October and December 2015.\nThese brands were rated using YouGov BrandIndex\u2019s buzz score and respondents were asked if they've heard anything about the brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or word of mouth, and if it was positive or negative.\nBuzz scores ranged from 100 to -100 and were compiled by subtracting negative feedback from positive.\nGoogle was ranked top with the highest buzz score of 28.4 in 2015, while YouTube and Aldi ranked second and third with 26.3 and 25.8 on the buzz index respectively.\n\u201cIn 2015, Google features on 16 of the Top Ten lists for the 24 countries tracked, reaching lead positions in Australia, Canada and Mexico.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s 2015 included a major restructuring to Alphabet, optimizing Android, and improved performance for countries with poor connectivity.

        "Packaging demand, inflationary pressures, the status of \"Wallula No. 3,\" and inventory levels are all topics shareholders should be conversant with.\nPackaging Corp. reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.18 last week, exceeding management's guidance of $2.16. After adjusting both the current and prior-year quarters for costs to convert the No. 3 paper machine at the company's Wallula, Washington mill to linerboard, Packaging Corp. reported EPS of $2.23, which outpaced Q3 2017's $1.68 in earnings by an impressive 33%. Below, we'll walk through key highlights from the earnings report that shareholders should consider when evaluating Packaging Corp.'s current condition.\nPackaging segment revenue rose 14% year over year, to $1.5 billion, driving total revenue up 10.4%, to $1.8 billion, and compensating for a slight decline in the paper segment, which dipped 6.3%, to $254.3 million.\nAs I discussed earlier this year, Packaging Corp. has fine-tuned its manufacturing operations over the last several quarters to take advantage of surging demand for cardboard packaging versus paper. The most visible aspect of this shift is the conversion of Wallula No. 3 from paper to packaging.\nDuring the last three months, the company hit record third-quarter corrugated shipments and achieved an all-time record for containerboard shipments.\nManagement is utilizing high demand to adjust pricing, which helps mitigate inflationary effects (which we'll address below). In the third quarter, price and mix improvement in the packaging segment contributed $0.38 of positive impact on EPS.\nIn a pattern similar to the last sequential quarter (Q2 2018), inflationary cost increases pressured the business. Packaging Corp. absorbed a $0.28 headwind in the form of operating cost increases over the last three months. Rising wages formed a prominent drag on costs in the third quarter, and management has signaled continuing wage inflation into the fourth quarter of 2018.\nIn addition, fuel expense impeded results, producing a drag of $0.08 on EPS (exclusive of the $0.28 in general operating costs above). Fuel costs are expected to rise again in the fourth quarter against the prior year, as management believes already elevated fuel prices will climb incrementally due to seasonally cold weather.\nSo far, the conversion of the Wallula No. 3 machine can be labeled a clear success. During the company's third-quarter earnings conference call, CEO Mark Kowlzan reminded investors that \"when we started up [the machine] in the first week of June, within the first two hours, we were selling premium high performance virgin kraft linerboard.\"\nThe No. 3 machine is currently out of service in a planned outage for the final implementation of conversion after which it will be able to run \"all out.\" By the beginning of November, the machine will be operating at its full capacity of 1,150 tons per day versus the 700 to 800 tons of daily output it recorded in the initial conversion phase.\nIn both the company's press release and its earnings conference call, Packaging Corp.'s management relayed to investors that inventory levels expanded significantly in the third quarter versus the prior-year quarter.\nContainerboard inventory jumped by 50,000 tons against the second quarter of 2018 and by 84,000 tons year over year. For perspective, 84,000 tons of inventory equals roughly seven weeks of production.\nManagement distilled three reasons for the inventory buildup. The first is to compensate for the current outage at Wallula No. 3, which will end in the first week of November. Second, quarter-end inventory levels were comparatively higher in Q3 2018, due to the company's acquisition of Sacramento Container Corporation in early October 2017. Those inventory level differences will be \"lapped\" after the fourth quarter of 2018.\nFinally, management is purposely bulking up inventory levels at various plants to try to keep containerboard available in strategic geographic locations across the U.S. to neutralize at least some of the current high cost of freight shipping.\nConversely, though it comprises a much smaller portion of the balance sheet, paper inventory has decreased roughly 39% year over year, primarily due to the conversion of Wallula No. 3 from paper to linerboard. Rising demand means that paper inventory may remain tight for the next few quarters. Even though paper volume fell in the third quarter, the company achieved positive pricing and mix in the paper segment, which provided a $0.13 beneficial impact to adjusted EPS.\nFor the final quarter of 2018, management expects high production levels to positively affect results, although the impact will be somewhat constrained by the cost headwinds discussed above. If you look at share-price movement, investors seem to be encouraged by the company's relative outperformance over the last three months and are reasonably optimistic regarding the upcoming period.\nIn my third-quarter earnings preview, I stated that Packaging Corp. would need a significant push beyond management's EPS guidance to jolt the \"PKG\" symbol out of its malaise. Shares indeed have received a jolt in a positive direction. Perhaps the company can build on the trend when it next reports in January.\nPackaging Corp. of America Earnings: Is a Third-Quarter Rebound in Store?\nCan Packaging Corp of America Continue to Outperform in 2018?",

        "It has been a while since we last heard any details on the promising PS3 exclusive DUST 514, but we\u2019re pleased to say that we have some very good news for you. Developers CCP have now confirmed that the game will definitely be free to download and play.\nPreviously, there were plans to introduce a cover charge since the game won\u2019t be coming on disc and will release on the PlayStation Network instead later this year. That cover charge was thought to be around $10 to $20, but CCP has now confirmed that they have scrapped the idea \u2013 much to our delight.\nLike Eve Online though, DUST 514 will still be supported by micro transactions. EVE Online players will be familiar with purchasing ISK for in-game transactions, but we can also tell you that ISK won\u2019t be compatible with DUST 514 purchases. This is because the upcoming PS3 shooter will use a different currency instead, known as Aurum and will be available in $10 \u2013 $100 quantities.\nThere\u2019s another little gem which we uncovered from executive producer Brandon Laurino in a recent interview with Eurogamer \u2013 DUST 514 will feature THOUSANDS of maps and they will be accessible to all players from the start as long as they can discover them.\nFor those of you who are worried about the paid element towards the game, CCP has also stated that items won\u2019t give paid players an unfair advantage over those that choose to play the game without paying. It also looks like those paid items can be earned in the game after a period of time, which is always a great option to have.\nAs previously stated by CCP, there will also be a PS Vita version on the way as well and we now have some additional information for you. The Vita version of DUST 514 will come in the form of an app, which will allow you to set up various aspects of your character and make transactions on the go while you are not on the PS3. These are only basic features we understand, with more cross-platform features to be announced prior to release.\nWe\u2019ve always felt that since DUST 514 was announced, it could well end up being Sony\u2019s secret weapon this year on the PS3. Now that the game is going free to play, CCP has probably put themselves in the bracket for one of the games of 2012. They could have easily put that $20 cover charge for the PSN download if they wanted to and people would have still bought it, especially those with EVE Online experience. So well done to them for making this decision which is sure to go down well with PS3 owners.\nAre you interested in playing DUST 514? If you have a Vita as well, let us know what kind of cross platform features you would like to see.\nI am a new player of EVE online, I started last month, but I am an avid PS# gamer, and am definitely going to get in on this game, as well as recruit all of my friends that do not play EVE. Looking forward to this.\nSounds like a winner. After playing EVE Online for just over seven years now, I\u2019m looking forward to picking up a PS3 so I can also give DUST a try. Just one error though: EVE Online is a subscription-based game, not a free-to-play with micro-transactions. Purchasing ISK with real-world money is, in fact, directly contrary to the EVE EULA and is a bannable offense if caught. What players CAN purchase for real money are Pilot License Extensions, called PLEX, which can either be used to extend one\u2019s subscription time or can be sold on the in-game Market for ISK.",
        "Can Twitter keep up its strong revenue growth?\nFor the most part, 2018 was a good year for Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) business. Sure, monthly active users turned downward in Q2 and Q3. But this was due to the company's aggressive (and important) efforts to improve the health of its platform. In addition, Twitter's year-over-year revenue growth rates accelerated as the year went on.\nBut there's still one more quarter from 2018 for Twitter to report. The company will release its fourth-quarter update on Feb. 7. Following a period of accelerating revenue growth and four consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability, expectations are high. Can Twitter deliver?\nHere's a preview of some key items to watch when Twitter reports fourth-quarter results.\nTwitter's top-line growth has been impressive recently. Third-quarter revenue increased 29% year over year -- an acceleration from 24% revenue growth in Q2. This momentum has been driven by broad-based growth across Twitter's various ad products and geographies.\nThough management didn't provide a forecast for its fourth-quarter revenue, Twitter CFO Ned Segal sounded confident during the company's third-quarter earnings call, noting that the company feels \"really good about the momentum that we've got going into the seasonally strong fourth quarter.\"\nAnalysts, on average, are expecting Twitter to report fourth-quarter revenue of about $870 million, representing 18.9% year-over-year growth.\nWith four quarters in a row of GAAP profitability behind it, Twitter has morphed into a reliably profitable company. Net income in the company's third quarter was $789 million, or $106 million when excluding a one-time net tax benefit recorded during the period. This compares to a loss of $21 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income in Q3 was $163 million, up from $78 million in the year-ago quarter. The company's third-quarter non-GAAP profit translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21.\nOn average, analysts are currently expecting Twitter to report non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 in Q4. This compares to non-GAAP EPS of $0.19 in the year-ago quarter.\nTwitter's user trends will likely see extra scrutiny when the company releases its fourth-quarter results. In Q2, Twitter's monthly active users declined by 1 million sequentially. This decline worsened in Q3, when monthly active users fell by 9 million sequentially.\nSome of the key factors that drove this decline in Twitter's monthly active users were the enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and greater prioritization of platform health by removing spammy and suspicious accounts.\nTwitter expects its monthly active users to decline further in Q4, as these factors continue to weigh on the metric.\nImpressively, Twitter's daily active user growth remained strong in Q3. Daily active users increased 9% year over year, helped by double-digit growth in five of the company's top 10 global markets. Investors should look for similarly strong growth in Twitter's daily active users in Q4.\nTwitter reports its fourth-quarter results before market open on Feb. 7.",
        "Throughout my public career \u2014 as a City Council member, state representative and secretary of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice \u2014 I worked to help children follow a path to success in life and, in particular, to restore hope for young black men. That explains the Florida Council on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys, which I sponsored in 2006 as a legislator, and my strong support for public education as a linchpin for a child's overall success.\nThe education facts are painfully clear. In Pinellas County last year, only 28 percent of black students read at grade level, and only 26 percent performed math at grade level. The latest Schott Foundation report is numbing, placing the graduation rate for black males in the county at 28 percent.\nThis is the kind of social crisis that should bring us all together, cause us to roll up our sleeves and pitch in to help. So it is good news that a circuit judge in Tallahassee recently tossed out a constitutional challenge to an education option that is helping 70,000 of Florida's most underprivileged students \u2014 a disproportionate percentage of whom are black.\nThe Florida Tax Credit Scholarship, which is helping 2,621 poor children mostly of color to attend 74 private schools in Pinellas this year, is not a substitute for the kind of great public schools that I have spent my life supporting. But it deserves a seat at the public education table, and let's hope the legal challengers to this program will listen to what the judge has had to say.\nFrom where I sit, this is not a competition, and this scholarship is not an attack on traditional public schools. The truth is that different students learn in different ways, and there is no reason we can't offer them a range of learning options that includes magnet and fundamental schools, online courses, dual enrollment, charter schools \u2014 and even scholarships to private schools for those who can't afford tuition.\nSome of the children I know as a pastor in St. Petersburg suffer from a form of educational despair, and these scholarships also open the door to faith-based schools that help them read and write in part by lifting their spirit. These are community-based schools that know the lives of their children and families, and, together, have built a bond that can translate into academic achievement. Where there is trust and hope, there can be learning.\nThe numbers so far tell that story. This state scholarship program is entering its 14th year this fall, and the students live, on average, in households that are only 5 percent above poverty. Two-thirds are black or Hispanic, more than half live with a single parent, and test scores show they were the lowest performers in the schools they left behind. For six straight years, though, these same students have been achieving the same standardized test score gains in reading and math as students of all incomes across the nation.\nThis is not to suggest the scholarship is some type of educational panacea. It's merely one tool that can help some children who can't otherwise afford it. Modern public education is being strengthened by the choices we empower parents to make, and we should embrace learning wherever it may occur.\nThe judge who dismissed the lawsuit made an important point in doing so. He said no one had proved the scholarship is harmful to public schools. He's right. The scholarship is a partner with public education, and it is just one more commitment we can make to children who desperately need our collective help.\nFrank Peterman Jr. is pastor of the Rock of Jesus Missionary Baptist Church in St. Petersburg and a government relations director.

        "Should Ventura County have a single fire department?\nWith more attention on fire in our daily lives, particularly with climate change, it is time to examine the need to restructure our fire service.\nFire \u2014 it\u2019s been the focus of our attention for the past couple of years. The Thomas Fire, wildfires all over the West, Santa Paula\u2019s turnover of fire service to the county, Ventura\u2019s budget negotiations with its fire department \u2014 fire is an ever-present story. I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to add a little more fuel to this fire discussion.\nSeveral years ago, Sacramento Bee columnist Dan Walters wrote an opinion piece discussing how, with the increases in wildfires in California and mutual aid arrangements, more and more city fire departments were siphoning off their own resources to aid those firefights.\nMeanwhile, at a couple of state Local Agency Formation Commission conferences a few years ago, there were panels discussing how several counties around the state were consolidating their fire departments into a single agency. Maybe it\u2019s time to begin that discussion here.\nWith Santa Paula joining the Ventura County Fire Department, the recent budget scrutiny over the city of Ventura\u2019s expenditure for fire department requests, and the continued need for the city of Oxnard to stabilize its budget, is it time to finally look at one countywide fire service?\nI raise this issue for several reasons. One, with the increase in wildfires, it seems there is a constant hit on city resources to help the county and state departments fight these fires.\nTwo, particularly in the case of Ventura, much more of its fire department\u2019s time is spent responding to medical emergencies than actually fighting fires.\nAnd three, during budget negotiations, firefighter unions have a way of playing cities off each other to boost their pay and benefits by threatening to jump to a neighbor city. City of Santa Paula firefighters would threaten to go to Ventura because the pay and benefits were better. Ventura firefighters would threaten to leave for Oxnard because the pay and benefits were better. And so on.\nThe arguments for a single, consolidated fire service in Ventura County \u2014 an expanded county fire department, if you will \u2014 is that it would eliminate this game of budgetary Chinese checkers, allow one complete organization to move its pieces around the game board however it saw fit as opposed to mutual aid responses, and possibly free up or expand medical emergency response teams within the cities for that singular purpose.\nI realize Ventura and Oxnard have longstanding, proud traditions with their city fire departments and recognize their contributions over the years. But times have changed, and perhaps it is time to examine a new model for fire service. For better, seamless customer service and good government, the discussion is at least worth having.\nIf Oxnard and Ventura were absorbed into a countywide fire district, it could reduce the tugs on city budgets and provide greater flexibility in moving firefighting resources around to areas of greatest need.\nToday, because of mutual aid, dispatching and the \u201cclosest to\u201d policy for responses, the city of Ventura is, de facto, already in the county system. Additionally, there are economies of scale. The city uses the county\u2019s training facilities and special equipment all the time. A consolidated force would simply remove one step in between.\nCreating such an expanded department would not be easy, but it is doable. There are already examples around the state.\nOne big concern would be the financial structure. Would a joint powers agreement and governing commission representing all 10 cities and the county, so rates and expenditures could be set in a manner fair to all, be better than a simple expansion of the existing county fire district, where the county sets the rates for participating cities? Ask Thousand Oaks about that arrangement.\nIs this a radical change? Yes. Is it a major departure from tradition and the way we\u2019ve done it in the past? Yes. Is it doable? I believe so.\nWith the increased attention on fire in our daily lives, particularly in the light of climate change, it is time to fully examine the need to restructure fire service in Ventura County.\nCarl Morehouse is a former Ventura City Council member and a past president of the Southern California Association of Governments.",
        "SANTA MARIA, Brazil \u2013 Penny-pinching by a band known for its onstage pyrotechnic displays may have cost more than 230 people their lives at a nightclub in southern Brazil, according to a state police inspector leading the investigation into this weekend&apos;s deadly blaze.\nInspector Marcelo Arigony told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that members of the band knowingly purchased flares meant for outdoor use because they cost a mere $1.25 a piece, compared with the $35 price tag for an indoor flare.\n\"The flare lit was for outdoor use only, and the people who lit them know that,\" said Arigony. \"They chose to buy those because they were cheaper than those that can be used indoors.\"\nThe repercussions of that choice continued to send shock waves through Santa Maria, a college town of 260,000 people that&apos;s been stunned by the early Sunday morning tragedy in the Kiss nightclub.\nThe Rio Grande do Sul state forensics department raised the death toll Tuesday from 231 to 234 to account for three victims who did not appear on the original list of the dead. Authorities say more than 120 people remain hospitalized for smoke inhalation and burns, with dozens of them in critical condition.\nThe blaze began at around 2:30 am local time, during a performance by Gurizada Fandangueira, a country music band that had made the use of pyrotechnics a trademark of their shows.\nPolice have said the club&apos;s ceiling was covered with an insulating foam made from a combustible material that appeared to have ignited after it came in contact with a spark from a flare lit during the performance.\nAfter the fire extinguisher malfunctioned, the blaze spread throughout the packed club at lightning speed, emitting a thick, toxic smoke. Because Kiss apparently had neither an alarm nor a sprinkler system and only one working exit, the crowd was left to search desperately for a way out.\nAbout 50 of the victims were found in the club&apos;s two bathrooms, where the blinding smoke caused them to believe the doors were exits.\nPolice investigator Arigony said people headed to the bathrooms because the only lights in the dark club were coming from there, and the patrons mistook them for exits.\n\"There were diverse irregularities,\" he said. \"Any child could have seen that this establishment should not have been open.\"\nOutraged locals marched through Santa Maria Tuesday to demand justice for the dead, an unusual move in a country where public protests are rare. The demonstration interrupted the police news conference, even as Arigony pledged to investigate everyone involved in the tragedy -- including the authorities charged with making sure such establishments are up to code, such as firefighters and city officials.\nThe fire inspired nationwide action, and several mayors said they would crack down on nightclubs and other venues in their cities.\nThe government of the country&apos;s biggest city, Sao Paulo, promised tougher security regulations for nightclubs and other places where many people gather. Since the fire, a Rio de Janeiro consumer complaint hotline has received more than 60 calls denouncing hazardous conditions at night spots, theaters, supermarkets, schools, hospitals and shopping malls around the state. Blocked emergency exits and nonexistent fire alarms and extinguishers top the list of most common complaints.\nG1, Globo television network&apos;s Internet portal, said police searched two other Santa Maria nightspots owned by Mauro Hoffmann, one of the partners of the Kiss nightclub, for evidence that could help shed light on the investigation.\nMonday night&apos;s searches yielded no evidence, and the site reported computers that stored images recorded by the Kiss club&apos;s security cameras have not yet been found. G1 cites a police investigator as saying the owners have insisted the club&apos;s closed-circuit camera system hadn&apos;t worked in months.\nBoth have been provisionally detained, along with two of the band members, and a judge has frozen the assets of both of the club&apos;s owners, pending the investigation.\nThe fire appeared to mark a possible turning point for a country that has long turned a blind eye to safety and infrastructure concerns. The disaster, the worst fire of its kind in more than a decade, has also raised questions of whether Brazilian authorities are up to the task of ensuring safety in such venues as the country prepares to host next year&apos;s World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.\nOne of Brazil&apos;s biggest newspapers, O Globo, published an editorial Tuesday saying it was time for action.\n\"The tragedy in Santa Maria forces us to seriously reflect over our national culture of leniency, contempt and corruption,\" it said. \"We must start from the principle that the mea culpa belongs to us all: public servants, owners of establishments that disregard safety regulations, and regular citizens who flout them.\"\nSoccer legend Pele, too, urged the Brazilian government to \"make safety and security a priority in this country.\"\n\"So many young people are no longer with us, they had entire lives ahead of them. I ask God to protect them and take care of their families,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nAccording to state safety codes here, clubs should have one fire extinguisher every 1,500 square feet as well as multiple emergency exits. Limits on the number of people admitted are to be strictly respected. None of that appears to have happened at the Santa Maria nightclub.\nRodrigo Martins, a guitarist for the group playing that night, told Globo TV network in an interview Monday that the flames broke out minutes after the employment of a pyrotechnic machine that fans out colored sparks.\nHe added that the club was packed with an estimated 1,200 to 1,300 people.\n\"I thought I was going to die there,\" Martins said. \"There was nothing I could do, with the fire spreading and people screaming in front.\"\nMost of the dead were college students 18 to 21 years old, but they also included some minors. Almost all died from smoke inhalation rather than burns. The Rio Grande do Sul state health secretary, Ciro Simoni, said 84 of the injured remained were in serious condition on Tuesday.\nThe blaze was the deadliest in Brazil since at least 1961, when a fire that swept through a circus killed 503 people in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro.\nSunday&apos;s fire also appeared to be the worst at a nightclub anywhere in the world since December 2000, when a welding accident reportedly set off a fire at a club in Luoyang, China, killing 309 people.",
        "Mubarak Deceived Israel as Muhammad Deceived Infidels?\nIn light of ousted president Hosni Mubarak's ongoing trial, Western readers may be surprised to learn who some of Mubarak's staunchest defenders are: Salafi Muslims, that is, those Muslims who practice the 7th century Islam of Muhammad, often referred to as \"radicals.\"\nHe [Hosni Mubarak] was the imam [Muslim leader]; all his actions have their circumstances. Regarding this gas issue you're talking about, whoever said that exporting gas to enemy combatants, Jews or otherwise, is impermissible? Who among the Muslim jurists [fuqaha] said this? The prophet himself died while his armor was held by a Jew [an infidel enemy] as collateral; and in the Battle of the Trench , the prophet negotiated with one of the polytheist tribes [enemies] to give them dates, Medina's main source of income, just so they would quit the war\u2014because \"war is deceit\"; he negotiated for this purpose . Nor did divine inspiration [Allah] come down to censure him for his actions, had such actions violated Sharia. So, show me one jurist saying that it is impermissible to deal with enemy combatants\u2014I do not say treaty-holders, as there is a treaty between us and the Jews, but I posit that between us and the Jews is war. So who among the classic jurists said that it is impermissible to deal with combatants, buying and selling? Here are the books of jurisprudence\u2026 I say the prophet negotiated with the polytheists to give them free dates just to keep their strength at bay at that time [as opposed to Mubarak, who only sold gas cheaply, Muhammad went one step further giving things for free]. So these are political and military matters, and the authority is free to pick whichever he deems most appropriate.\nAlong with stressing Muhammad's attempt to appease Islam's infidel enemies with gifts when the latter were stronger than the Muslims, the sheikh also stressed that Mubarak was the \"sultan\"\u2014an Arabic-Islamic term of special significance, conveying a certain form of sovereign political and temporal authority in Islam, complete with dispensations unavailable to the average Muslim.\nNor are these arcane notions; al-Qaeda itself has stressed these exact points. When discussing the permissibility for Muslims to deceive infidels, the late Osama bin Laden often alluded to Muhammad's attempt to appease the infidel tribe; and Ayman Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's new leader, quotes Islam's jurists as \"unanimously agreeing\" that \"it is forbidden to overthrow\" Muslim rulers, even if they are \"cruel and despotic\" yet \"it is obligatory to wage jihad against\" Muslim rulers found to be \"apostate infidels\" (The Al Qaeda Reader, pgs. 26-27, 121-122, 129 ).\nThe non-hijabbed, Westernized looking female host, somewhat flustered, retorted: \"Excuse me sheikh, but this issue of comparing the actions of our blessed prophet and a former president, I mean, forgive me, but maybe one can't speak on or judge between similar circumstances.\"\nThen Montaser al-Zayyat, an Islamist lawyer who regularly represents jihadists\u2014including, formerly, Zawahiri\u2014chimed in saying he too \"found it hard listening to the sheikh,\" insisting that Mubarak should be condemned for selling gas to \"the Zionists, for this is a betrayal of the [Egyptian] people.\"\nEventually, the debate descended into the usual shouting and yelling, with the sheikh boasting that at least Mubarak was a hero in Egypt's 1973 war with Israel, and asking the hostess and Zayyat, \"Where were you on October 6, 1973?... Did you ever shoot a single bullet at a Jew?!\"\nThis leads to the most telling aspect of this whole anecdote: while the two Muslim experts on Sharia argued over many things, there was no disagreement over two points\u2014enmity for Israel and Jews, and the permissibility of using deceit to undermine them.",
        "Adweek: So what\u2019s a digital-media tyro like you doing at a fusty old-media company like CBS?\nJim Lanzone: I don\u2019t really think of it that way at all. People think the Internet will supercede TV, but it\u2019s really been more additive than anything else, largely because it\u2019s so portable. It\u2019s not taking anything away from linear television; if anything, it\u2019s encouraged people to spend even more time watching video.\nAW: The fact that we can watch TV on a telephone: is this doing something insidious to the parts of our brain that process narrative?\nJL: Think about the very early days of TV\u2014the first shows were structured just like radio broadcasts or Broadway shows. You start with the familiar and you expand from there. Creative people haven\u2019t taken advantage of the new media platforms; we\u2019re still in this brackish time between two eras.\nAW: You still watch TV?\nJL: I\u2019m a binge watcher. I have DirecTV, so I have a ton of shows on the DVR: The Daily Show, [Real Time With] Bill Maher, SNL. I\u2019ve been watching How I Met Your Mother for six years. There are definitely more shows out there that I want to watch that I don\u2019t have time to watch, which I suppose is a great sign of where programming is headed.\nAW: Why did CBS issue a fatwa against Hulu?\nAW: Can you write code?\nJL: I never got into programming when I was a kid. I was too busy playing Pitfall and Kaboom! on Atari to write code. But then again, I don\u2019t think Les Moonves knows how to make a television set either.\nAW: So there\u2019s no disconnect between the old media centers\u2014New York, L.A.\u2014and Silicon Valley?\nJL: Well, you\u2019re looking at it from a geographic standpoint and that really isn\u2019t relevant any longer. I think Silicon Valley is the third leg of the media stool; I mean, there\u2019s a reason why all the animated features are made in Silicon Valley now. Engineers are the new artists of this generation of media.\nAW: Are you from Silicon Valley?\nJL: I grew up in San Carlos, where Oracle now stands. In fact, they built Oracle on the old Marine World site. George Lucas used some of the elephants from Marine World in Star Wars, and after it came out\u2014I must have seen it 25 times that summer\u2014they started offering Bantha rides at Marine World.\nAW: Speaking of which, what the hell happened to George Lucas? Those three Star Wars prequels were just god-awful.\nJL: I know what happened to George Lucas: the \u201880s. If movies peaked in the \u201870s, then it\u2019s fair to say that the 2000s is the Renaissance period for TV. The new Battlestar [Galactica] was at least a thousand times better than the old one. And I almost didn\u2019t watch it at first because I was afraid it was going to ruin my childhood memories of the original.",
        "The hope is that at least some of the pilot studies will provide results that help in a shorter amount of time.\nA little more than two years after the announcement of a landmark partnership between the NFL and Harvard Medical School for a long-term study on the aftereffects of football on retired players, it is progressing better than many involved expected.\nSpurred by a number of factors: growing concerns over the long-term effects of concussions, the suicides of multiple retired players, growing national sentiment that football was too dangerous, a Harvard study showing the life expectancy for former professional players in the United States and Canada is 20 years less than the general male population, the NFL Players Association decided to take things into its own hands.\nThe union dedicated $100 million over 10 years to fund what is now known as the Football Players Health Study at Harvard, though the project is much more than the extensive survey, which seeks to identify the myriad health problems former players face.\nThe project got under way in February 2014, with the survey and three pilot studies launched immediately. Four studies have since been added, selected after the medical teams received dozens of proposals.\nTo date, more than 2,100 former players have completed the health survey. While it\u2019s great progress, it represents only about one-10th of the number who could participate. To Harvard researchers, there is value in getting any living player who took part in even a week\u2019s worth of practices as a practice squad player to respond, not just players who were part of the NFL for years.\nWhile the survey is a long-term project, the hope is that at least some of the pilot studies will provide results and help in a shorter amount of time.\n\u25a0 Bioenhanced ACL repair. Over the last four seasons, 230 NFL players have suffered torn ACLs, a common injury for athletes across many sports. Dr. Martha Murray, also a Harvard Medical School assistant professor and orthopedic surgeon at Children\u2019s, appears to have developed a way for the ACL to repair itself. Currently, reconstructive surgery on the ligament involves the use of cadaver or hamstring tissue or the patellar tendon of the patient to restabilize the knee. Recovery time is months, and 80 percent of ACL repair patients will develop osteoarthritis in the joint within 14 years. Murray\u2019s method creates a scaffold of sorts around the torn ligament, allowing blood to flow between the torn ends, and the ACL essentially repairs itself. In animal studies, the animals had less muscle loss, with no occurrence of osteoarthritis. The first human clinical studies have recently started.\n\u25a0 Light-emitting diodes for treating concussions. Studies show that there is less blood flow to the brain for days or even weeks after a concussion, and less blood flow slows healing. This study, in which Meehan is involved, works with the hypothesis that the brain needs more adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, the energy-carrying molecule found in cells, to heal, and that brain cells with more ATP will recover more quickly. By shining red/near-infrared light on brain cells, there is an increase in metabolic activity. Participants in preliminary trials are reporting improved sleep and fewer post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.\n\u25a0 Myocardial dysfunction. This study, led by Dr. Aaron Baggish, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor of medicine based out of Massachusetts General Hospital, seeks to find the effects of strength training on the heart. \u201cPeople who are long-distance runners, cyclists, have \u2018big hearts\u2019 in a way that\u2019s beneficial,\u201d Meehan said. \u201cBut maybe lifting weights makes [the heart] bigger in a way that\u2019s not beneficial.\u201d Testing has found that strength training can make heart walls stiff and inflexible, and makes it difficult for the organ to rest properly. As Baggish\u2019s work proceeds, it will look for ways to intervene and prevent that stiffness.\n\u25a0 Osteoarthritis hydrogel. Currently, options for treating osteoarthritis are limited to physical therapy, oral pain medications, or steroid injections, which patients can receive only every few months, and often, total joint replacement. A team of Harvard Medical School assistant professors based out of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital is developing an injectable hydrogel that kicks into action and provides pain relief when an individual\u2019s joint is inflamed. The rest of the time, it essentially waits.\nConcussion data from mouthguards worn by football players, collected by i1 Biometrics, is shown.\n\u25a0 Detecting brain movement in the skull. There are mouthguards and helmets designed to detect concussive hits, but those only measure the impact on the implements, not the actual brain. Led by Dr. Gary Strangman, a Harvard Medical School associate professor of psychology based at Mass General, the goal is to develop an on-the-field, non-invasive device that can monitor the movement of the brain while players are in motion.\n\u25a0 Tau protein antibody. Recent medical research shows that tau proteins in the brain contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s. Dr. Ping Lu, a Harvard Medical School professor of medicine based at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and his team have developed an antibody that in animal studies blocks the spread of tau but prevents brain cells from dying.\n\u25a0 Injury-preventing knee brace. The brace Conor Walsh, a Harvard professor of mechanical and biomedical engineering, is trying to develop, would prevent ACL tears. The brace would be soft, not limiting the range of motion of the wearer \u2014 that is, unless the tibia (shin bone) starts to move in front of the femur (thigh bone). If that happens, the brace would lock into place, preventing the tibia from moving too far forward, which leads to a torn ACL.\nMassachusetts native Zak DeOssie, heading into his ninth season with the Giants and a member of the NFLPA executive committee, believes current players are far more invested in their long-term health, and he is excited by the prospects of the studies.\nHealth and safety is paramount, DeOssie said, as is making sure there are future generations of players who learn the great lessons of football.\nGreg Hardy\u2019s suspension was reduced to four games.\nNot surprisingly, last week came and went without an announcement of a decision on Tom Brady\u2019s appeal of his four-game Deflategate suspension, but on Friday afternoon the league did announce a decision on the appeal for Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy.\nHardy had his 10-game suspension reduced to four games by arbitrator Harold Henderson, a former NFL labor executive. In May 2014 while with the Panthers, Hardy\u2019s girlfriend accused him of assault. The woman said that in an attack at his apartment, Hardy pulled her on the floor by her hair, choked her with both hands, and picked her up over his head, throwing her onto a couch that had guns on it. He also threatened to kill her.\nAs Hardy\u2019s case went through the North Carolina legal process, he played Week 1 for Carolina. But then the team decided to deactivate him for Week 2, and ultimately placed him on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list. Hardy was paid his full salary for the remainder of the season but was not allowed to practice or play.\nThough the case against Hardy was dismissed on appeal (he had been found guilty by a judge in a non-jury trial) when the victim did not make herself available to prosecutors, the NFL\u2019s investigation found enough evidence to determine that Hardy deserved punishment under the personal conduct policy.\nCommissioner Roger Goodell gave Hardy a 10-game suspension, which Henderson significantly reduced.\nThe announcement immediately brought up questions regarding Brady\u2019s case. As it stands, in the eyes of the league doing the heinous things Hardy was accused of is on the same level as what the league believes Brady likely knew about what happened with footballs before the AFC Championship game.\nEven before the Hardy decision, there was no question Brady\u2019s suspension should be reduced, but keep in mind there\u2019s an X factor: Goodell refused to recuse himself as arbitrator in Brady\u2019s case, so he is deciding against his/Troy Vincent\u2019s decision. There is no Harold Henderson or Judge Barbara Jones (who decided on Ray Rice\u2019s appeal) to apply logic in this situation.\nGoodell could dig in his heels after taking some high-profile losses and decide to uphold Brady\u2019s four-game penalty, though in that case Brady might take the league to court. Or, being as public relations-conscious as Goodell seems to be, he could realize that it looks ridiculous to have a player who might have known about an infraction that might have happened serve the same suspension as a player who, evidence shows, assaulted a woman, and reduce Brady\u2019s suspension to two games or even one.\nIncidentally, if Hardy does not take his case to court \u2014 there were reports that if his suspension was not reduced to two games he would take that action \u2014 his first game would be against the Patriots Oct. 11.\nThrough its punishment of the Patriots and Tom Brady, the NFL wants you to believe that it takes the PSI level of footballs very seriously. But if the league is truly serious about it, why not do a little research?\nSo here\u2019s an idea: Do that, for every ball, at every game this season. Take the notion of whether or not Jim McNally surreptitiously did something with the footballs off the table for a moment, because if he did, the Patriots deserve punishment.\nBut instead of theories on Ideal Gas Law and weather and Ted Wells taking referee Walt Anderson\u2019s word on some things (his recollection of the approximate PSI levels of the Patriots\u2019 and Colts\u2019 footballs before the AFC title game) but not others (Anderson said his \u201cbest recollection\u201d was that he used the gauge with a Wilson logo to measure the balls pregame but Wells dismissed that), why not get an idea of just how much footballs fluctuate during games?\nIt\u2019s expected the league will have some new rules this season when it comes to the handling of footballs (here\u2019s hoping that a more stringent accounting of each ball\u2019s measurement and having the balls stay with officials the entire time and not handed off to a game-day attendant are at the top of the list) because of Deflategate.\nAnd for this year at least, some data should be gathered.\nLet\u2019s use the Patriots-Steelers Week 1 game as an example. In a best-case scenario, Official A would be assigned to measure the Patriots\u2019 12 footballs pregame, and then again at halftime, using the same gauge, and Official B would measure the Steelers\u2019 footballs pregame and at halftime.\nThe numbers be written down each time \u2014 this would necessitate that each ball have a serial number. Weather conditions would also be recorded.\nWith each team getting 12 footballs per game and 256 regular-season games, that\u2019s 6,144 measurements \u2014 and should give a good idea of just how much footballs can fluctuate during a game given different conditions. And if the Patriots\u2019 footballs from the AFC title game fall outside of what the data shows to be the norm, then take their first-round pick away next April.\nWill it happen? Highly unlikely. But if the NFL is all about integrity, as Roger Goodell and Troy Vincent remind us as often as possible, it\u2019s an experiment worth conducting.\nThe NFL began playing games in London in 2007.\nThe NFL\u2019s love affair with London isn\u2019t ending any time soon, not that we expected it would.\nThis past week, the league announced a 10-year partnership with soccer club Tottenham Hotspur. Tottenham is beginning construction on a 61,000-seat stadium that\u2019s set to open in 2018, and the agreement calls for two NFL games per year to be played there.\nThe facility will have a retractable grass surface, which Tottenham will use. When hidden under the stands, it will reveal an artificial surface for American football games. There will also be a set of larger locker rooms, as NFL rosters are significantly bigger than those for soccer.\nThe deal is not exclusive, meaning the NFL can play games at other facilities in the United Kingdom. But the league has long held the idea of having a permanent team in London, and having a stadium built with the NFL in mind could be another step in that direction.\nThe NFL began playing games in London in 2007, and thus far all but one of the 11 games played there have sold out Wembley Stadium, which has a capacity of 86,000.\nWhile American football is growing in popularity in the UK, a BBC story on the NFL-Tottenham partnership cited research that shows 2.8 million people in the country say they are \u201cvery interested\u201d in the NFL \u2014 that\u2019s less than 5 percent of the population. The number of adults who say they play American football at least once a month is at 40,000, a number that has doubled over the last four years.\nThe Manning Passing Academy is celebrating its 20th anniversary and has become a proving ground for the country\u2019s best quarterbacks. Dartmouth College coach Buddy Teevens, a Pembroke native and Silver Lake High graduate, is one of five men to be part of every camp, joining Peyton, Eli, and Cooper Manning, and Jeff Hawkins, now at Oregon but once Teevens\u2019s recruiting coordinator at Tulane . . .

        "In their victory speeches, Vice President Cheney and President Bush claimed a \"mandate,\" \"historic victory,\" and that \"America has spoken.\"\nPundits have declared that the election was about \"moral values.\" Americans in the red states voted against homosexual marriage and abortion.\nLet's hope that this is correct. Otherwise, America is doomed if Bush's reelection is based on his economic and foreign policy record.\nCan you imagine our peril if Bush's mandate is for unprecedented trade and budget deficits and job loss? Or for taking the country to war based on incompetence or deception?\nThankfully, the electorate did not give Bush a mandate for getting thousands of Americans killed and maimed for no other reason than the Bush administration's inability to assess the intent and capability of Iraq.\nBush's reelection is not a mandate for establishing a dozen or more permanent US military bases in Iraq and expanding the war to Syria, Lebanon, and Iran.\nIf Bush limits his second term to homosexual marriage and abortion, we and the world will be a lot safer. Medical doctors will not stop putting the mother's life first, and homosexuals are no more in need of marriage than the large percentage of heterosexuals who have abandoned it. Homosexual marriage has never been much more than a way to assert legitimacy that most rubs opponents' noses in the proverbial.\nIf Americans allow Cheney, Bush and their neoconservative masters to claim a mandate for preemptive attack against misperceived enemies and for removing disliked dictators, no draft aged American and few countries without nuclear weapons are safe.\nIf Republicans claim a mandate for moving American jobs offshore while amnestying millions of illegals, no American's job is secure. If Bush claims a mandate for unprecedented red ink, American children have no future.\nBy all means, please let's keep Bush's mandates limited to moral values. Let us not even criticize the Christian right-wing for preening their \"moral values\" feathers while ratifying an illegal invasion that has killed somewhere between 15,000 and 100,000 innocent Iraqis, mostly women and children, and ended or ruined the lives of some 10,000 American sons, fathers, husbands and brothers.\nFor our own sakes, we must limit Bush's mandate to a veto of homosexual marriage and to Supreme Court appointments that might, possibly, overturn Roe v. Wade.\nNo mandate for preemptive war.\nNo mandate for American Empire.\nNo mandate for isolating America from its allies.\nNo mandate for Israeli territorial expansion in the Middle East.\nNo mandate for endless red ink. No mandate for selling out American jobs and occupations to foreigners.\nNo mandate for a domestic police state.",
        "The public art project would be the world's largest if all eight tanks are completed.\nSOUTH PORTLAND \u2013 As luck would have it, Jaime Gili flew into Portland at night. That meant he would have to wait until morning to see his handiwork.\nBut Gili, the London-based artist who was chosen by the Maine Center for Creativity to adorn the oil tanks at the Sprague Energy tank farm near the Portland International Jetport, wouldn\u2019t settle for daybreak.\n\u201cI could still spot it,\u201d Gili said, describing how he peered out the window of the plane into the dark during his nighttime landing, determined to catch his first view of the painted oil tank.\nGili is back in town this week, preparing a second tank for his design in the Maine Center for Creativity\u2019s Art All Around public art project.\nThis one will be abstract like the first \u2014 lots of sharp, intersecting angles \u2014 but with slightly different colors: blue, orange, black and spruce.\nIf time and money permit, the Maine Center for Creativity hopes to complete as many as three more tanks this summer.\nIn all, the center aims to paint eight tanks and eight tank tops. To do so, it will need to raise about $1.2 million. To date, it has raised about $600,000, said Greg Boulos, president of the center\u2019s board of directors.\nGili wasn\u2019t in town last fall when the first tank was completed. He has seen photos of the tank, and he worked closely with the painters while they executed his design and vision. He was in daily, and sometimes hourly, contact by phone and e-mail during the painting process.\nBut seeing the tank was something else altogether. \u201cWhen you get up close, it\u2019s awesome,\u201d Gili said.\nThe Maine Center for Creativity hosted a press conference at the South Portland Community Center on Monday morning to bring attention to the second phase of the tank project. Members of the center\u2019s board, its supporters, business people and municipal leaders turned out to rally for Art All Around.\nWhen completed, the tank project will involve 260,000 square feet of painted surface, making it the largest public art painting in the world.\nCharles Lawton, a business owner in South Portland and a member of the Maine Center for Creativity\u2019s board, said Art All Around is good for the Maine economy because it emphasizes the link between creativity and industry.\nThat link is essential to economic growth, because creativity leads to job growth, said Lawton, who writes a column for the Maine Sunday Telegram.",
        "It is possible more people who came in contact with a man who died from the Ebola virus in Dallas, Texas, could test positive for the virus in the coming days, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday.\nTom Frieden offered this possibility a day after a preliminary diagnosis showed that a health care worker who had \u201cextensive contact\u201d with Thomas Eric Duncan tested positive for Ebola. If the test is confirmed, this would be the first known case of Ebola being contracted or transmitted in the United States.\nThe level of the virus in the woman\u2019s system was \u201clow,\u201d Frieden said, adding that another test to confirm whether she has the virus will be conducted later Sunday.\nFrieden said at least 48 people who came in contact with Duncan before he was admitted to the hospital in Dallas are at risk of contracting the virus.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola,\u201d Frieden said.\n\u201cThe risk is in the 48 people who are being monitored, all of whom have been tested daily, none of whom so far have developed symptoms or fever,\u201d Frieden said.\nAn \u201cintensive investigation\u201d is also being conducted to determine others who may have come in contact with Duncan while he was being treated, because they may have been exposed as well, Frieden added. Some of these workers could have had a breach in contamination control similar to the one that led to the nurse being infected, he said.\nWhen the nurse became feverish on Friday, she reported it and was given a preliminary test for the virus, which turned up positive Saturday night, Frieden said.\nThe CDC and Texas health officials are investigating how many people the nurse came in contact with after coming down with symptoms of the disease.\nFrieden said the CDC has sent additional staff to Dallas to assist with the response. The agency will also enhance training of health care workers who may have to treat patients with the virus.\nThe key to stopping the spread of the disease is to \u201cbreak the chains of transmission,\u201d he said. This involves promptly diagnosing anyone who has symptoms of the disease, isolating that individual, identifying everyone this person came in contact with and actively monitor those people over a 21-day period. If any of these contacts comes down with Ebola symptoms, then the same process starts over again.\nDavid Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, who also participated in the news briefing, agreed.\n\u201cI firmly believe we will stop it,\u201d Lakey said.",

        "BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - China will scale back its subsidies for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles faster than expected, while declining to give subsidies to traditional hybrids, according to policy documents posted on the finance ministry\u2019s website on Wednesday.\nThe final version of the policy largely confirmed a previously released draft in setting levels for new energy vehicle subsidies in 2016, but will scale back those subsidies by 20 percent in 2017-2018 and by 40 percent in 2019-2020.\nThe draft had only called for two 10-percent reductions by 2020.\nTraditional hybrid, which rely mostly on gasoline engines, remains a key peg of many company\u2019s strategies in China, with Toyota Motor aiming to launch Corolla and Levin hybrid models later this year and Geely Automobile working on a hybrid version of its Emgrand 7 midsize sedan.\nBy rolling back subsidies faster, the government wants to pressure automakers to reduce their currently high price for new energy vehicles, rather than relying on subsidies to profit, said Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight in Shanghai.\nThe highest subsidy for a single car is roughly 100,000 yuan ($16,119.7), as local authorities generally offer subsidies to match those of the central government, so a 20-40 percent reduction is quite large, he said.\nThe government subsidy scheme, along with an aggressive ratcheting up of emission and fuel economy standards by 2020, aims to bring relief to pollution choked cities in the world\u2019s largest car market.\nChinese and foreign automakers unveiled plans for a slew of new energy vehicles at the Shanghai autoshow last week in an effort to meet the government\u2019s stringent goals.\nShanghai GM, a joint venture between General Motors and SAIC Motor, said at the show that it would develop 10 new energy models by 2020.\nThe policy is \u201csending a signal to the car makers that the government is quite determined to use some of the stick instead of the carrot by the end of this decade,\u201d Zhang said.\nThe scheme lays out in detail the subsidies based on the type of vehicle and the distance it can travel.\nElectric and plug-in passenger cars will receive between 25,000 and 55,000 yuan per vehicle from the central government.",
        "The PC maker is planning to sell new storage and server gear, but it must convince potential customers that it is committed to the market.\nLAS VEGAS--Aiming to bolster its corporate business, Gateway on Tuesday plans to announce a new lineup of storage gear and servers running SuSE Linux.\nAs previously reported, Gateway plans to make Linux-based servers a standard part of its lineup rather than a custom offering. In the storage area, the company is adding two products of its own and also will begin reselling Hitachi's Thunder 9500. The Hitachi product will not carry the Gateway brand, although Gateway plans to offer service and support.\nUnder its own name, Gateway in December will sell a RAID (redundant array of independent disks) product using Serial ATA drives with 3 terabytes of storage for $7,199. The company will also offer a network-attached storage appliance for use in racks that has 1TB of storage for $4,799.\nThe products mark Gateway's return to the storage market and are part of the company's broader effort to tap corporate spending.\nOne of the challenges the company faces is convincing business customers it is committed to the market. Gateway became a large server seller with the purchase of Advanced Logic Research in the 1990s but had all but abandoned the market in recent years.

        "Cheeburger Cheeburger, Easton's newest dining spot, had a full house today -- and it's not even open yet.\nMore than 100 people crowded in front of the gourmet burger shop as officials conducted a ribbon-cutting organized by the Easton Area Chamber of Commerce, part of the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce.\nThe 1950s-themed restaurant at 336 Northampton St. in the former Pomeroy's building opens to the public at 11:30 a.m. Thursday.\nGeneral manager Frank Aversa partnered with owner John Jaindl to bring the franchise to Easton. It will employ about 60 full- and part-time workers.\nBurger prices range from $5.59 for a quarter-pounder to $10.99 for a 20-ouncer. Customers can pick from nine different cheeses and dozens of toppings.\n\"You can invent your own taste,\" said Aversa, who had owned a Cheeburger Cheeburger franchise in Flemington.\nIn Flemington, Aversa got to know Pomeroy's developer Mark Mulligan through the business improvement district.

        "The entire NBA has been afflicted by Warriors Derangement Syndrome.\nThe NBA is on the verge of a collective nervous breakdown.\nJohn Wall, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and LeBron James.\nPhoto illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo/Slate. Photos by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images, Ronald Cortes/Getty Images, Patrick Smith/Getty Images, Andy Lyons/Getty Images.\nEver since July 4, 2016\u2014the day Kevin Durant announced he was leaving Oklahoma City to sign with the Golden State Warriors\u2014the NBA has been plagued by whispers that it would become fatally boring. The Warriors will win the next four, five, or six titles. The only drama will be whether they\u2019ll average 70 wins a season or 75.\nGolden State is more or less living up to its end of things\u2014the team coasted to a title in its first season with Durant and currently sits atop the league with a tidy 39\u201310 record. Barring injury, they are the prohibitive favorites to win the 2018 NBA title. Sure, someone else could win this year\u2019s championship. It\u2019s also possible the sun could take tomorrow off and we could wake up to find the forest moon of Endor hanging in the sky.\nBut while the NBA has become predictable in one sense, it is anything but boring. That\u2019s because a condition known as Warriors Derangement Syndrome is ravaging the league\u2019s top also-rans, with bizarre and fascinating results. A generation of NBA stars now faces each day with the understanding that the road to the NBA title will go through the Bay Area for the next half-decade (at least). In an era in which social media amplifies both individual personalities and organizational palace intrigue to unprecedented decibels, players and teams obsessively weigh their loyalty to each other against their investment in their personal legacies, and anonymous back-stabbing and surreptitious alliance building rule the day. To put it another way: Everyone is losing their minds, and it\u2019s fantastic to behold.\nIt became clear this week that this epidemic is leaving no corner of the league unscathed. On Monday, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Michael C. Wright reported that relations had grown strained between the San Antonio Spurs and superstar wing Kawhi Leonard, who\u2019s recovering from a right quadriceps injury and has appeared in only nine games this season. The story was a standard-issue cocktail of on-background, anonymous innuendo and on-the-record, less-than-convincing denials. \u201cThere is no issue between the Spurs organization and Kawhi,\u201d declared Spurs general manager R.C. Buford, before conceding that Leonard\u2019s \u201crehab hasn\u2019t been simple, and it hasn\u2019t gone in a linear fashion.\u201d The next day, ESPN analyst Jalen Rose appeared on First Take and announced that \u201cKawhi Leonard wants out of San Antonio.\u201d Rose said Leonard was losing faith in San Antonio\u2019s ability to draw top-flight free-agent talent, a statement that could easily be construed as a shot at Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge, one of the league\u2019s marquee free-agent signings of the past several years.\nRose\u2019s words should be taken with a Boogie Cousins\u2013sized grain of salt: He\u2019s not a journalist and has a penchant for mischievous provocation going back to his playing days. But the fact that there\u2019s even a whiff of smoke in San Antonio is extremely telling. The Spurs are the most stable and ruthlessly successful NBA franchise of the past two decades. Leonard, who is one of the NBA\u2019s four or five best players when healthy, is the latest in a long line of Spurs greats that includes David Robinson, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili, all of whom spent their entire NBA careers with the team. No one leaves the Spurs or even talks about being unhappy on the Spurs. The Spurs, we thought, were post-drama. But alas, these are the crippling effects of Warriors Derangement Syndrome.\nOrdinarily a story as explosive as \u201cKawhi Leonard wants out of San Antonio\u201d would chew through several days\u2019 worth of news cycles. But within 24 hours of breaking the Leonard story, Wojnarowski dropped another bomb, this one about a team meeting in Cleveland in which the Cavs\u2019 Kevin Love was accused by several unnamed teammates of either faking or exaggerating an illness. The story was attributed to anonymous sources, a designation that\u2019s been so ubiquitous around the Cavs in recent years that it probably deserves a share of the team\u2019s 2016 title. (Less than a week earlier, several Cavs players had conducted a bizarre \u201canonymous\u201d press conference in which they told reporters from three different news outlets they were concerned the team\u2019s struggles were unfixable.) But the Love story was a new height of weirdness. Who leaked this, and why? Was it LeBron James, media specialist, trying to sprinkle some narrative breadcrumbs ahead of his impending departure? Was it Love himself, trying to force a trade out of Cleveland? Was it coach Tyronn Lue, trying to spin the team\u2019s recent struggles as a matter of locker-room discord rather than in-game strategy?\n\u201cWho leaked it?\u201d wasn\u2019t even a question in the case of the Washington Wizards\u2019 latest fiasco. The Wiz, who started the season with Eastern Conference title hopes, are currently stalled in the middle of the pack and recently suffered blowout losses to the lowly Charlotte Hornets and Dallas Mavericks. After the former contest, point guard John Wall divulged details of a players-only meeting to the Washington Post: \u201cA couple guys took [the meeting] the negative way and it hurt our team. Instead of taking it in a positive way like we did in the past and using it to build our team up, it kind of set us back a little bit.\u201d Responding to Wall\u2019s comments\u2014in the same Post story, no less\u2014the team\u2019s other star, Bradley Beal, observed, \u201cIt was tough. I try to keep all our stuff as personal as possible but I think in a way not everybody got a chance to speak whenever they wanted to.\u201d Players-only meetings can serve a lot of purposes. Using them as rehearsal spaces for media squabbles is a pioneering use of the form.\nAs the Feb. 8 trade deadline approaches, it\u2019s clear the symptoms of Warriors Derangement Syndrome will only intensify. The most pivotal player in the league is still in Cleveland, and the impending free agent might not stick around after this season. The only way for the Cavs to keep LeBron James is to surround him with enough talent that he thinks he has a chance to beat the Warriors, a prospect that seems dimmer by the day. One of the speculative destinations for LeBron is San Antonio, a prospect that might be feeding into Leonard\u2019s grumblings: Get me LeBron, or get me out of here. Another potential landing spot is Houston, which acquired point guard Chris Paul in the offseason\u2014one of James\u2019 closest friends\u2014and is widely regarded as the league\u2019s second-best team.\nBut the Rockets, too, have been acting a bit nutty as of late, commemorating Martin Luther King Jr. Day by unsuccessfully seeking out a post-game brawl with Paul\u2019s former team, the Los Angeles Clippers. Then, just this past weekend, the Rockets dealt the Warriors a rare loss, prompting Houston center Clint Capela to declare the Rockets \u201cbetter\u201d than the Warriors, a pretty stupid statement to make about arguably the best team in history, particularly when your own team has a lengthy history of flaming out in the playoffs.\nMeanwhile in Golden State, things are more or less humming along. The Warriors are leading the league in every meaningful offensive category, Kevin Durant is emerging as a fashionable MVP favorite, and four of the team\u2019s five starters have been named to the All-Star Game for the second consecutive season, a first in NBA history. That last fact has left Russell Westbrook feeling aggrieved, with the Oklahoma City point guard saying it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that his teammate Paul George got left off the team while there were \u201cfour people from one team.\u201d Westbrook, Durant\u2019s former teammate, is Warriors Derangement Syndrome\u2019s \u201cpatient zero.\u201d Since his affliction, he\u2019s averaged a triple-double for a full season and won his own MVP award. And if he wants a championship ring? Maybe Durant will let him borrow one of his.\nJack Hamilton is Slate\u2019s pop critic and assistant professor of American studies and media studies at the University of Virginia.

        "The book, Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique, did not help the borrower save his marriage, his family confirmed in an apology note to the library.\nLast year, the New York Public Library received a book nearly 54 years after its due date which was Aug. 17, 1959.\nBilly Parrott, the managing librarian at NYPL's Mid-Manhattan Library, brought the incident to light in his recent, and hilarious, blog post which spoke of the stigmas associated with returning overdue books.\nHe suggested that this Seinfeld episode, the one with \"a long overdue copy of Tropic of Cancer and the quick, hardboiled reprimands from the library cop named Bookman,\" could have triggered guilty associations with returning a book too late.\nThe long overdue book was Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique by Dutch gynecologist Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde.\nParrott told BuzzFeed that books are generally returned late either because the borrower felt guilt or shame for keeping the book for so long or was simply forgetful.\nIn this case however, Parrott suggested the \"subject matter of this book speaks to all the reasons why materials are returned late.\"\nIn his words, Ideal Marriage is \"a very wordy and very scientific instruction manual for sexual activity written in 1926.\"\nParrot said he has only thumbed through the book which entails lots of numbers, charts, and graphs and includes sentences such as \"herewith designate the full range of contact and connection, between human beings, for sexual consummation.\"\n\"In addition to the guilt associated with overdue fines the patron also had to bear the humiliation of returning such a lurid book,\" Parrott wrote in his blog.\nThe book was returned along with an apologetic note from the borrower's \"shocked-in-law\" in Arizona.

        "ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Erin, thanks very much.\nGood evening, everyone. We have breaking news tonight. Exclusive new details that you will only see on this program about the attack in Libya that killed four Americans, including ambassador Christopher Stevens and two former Navy Seals, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. They died heroes, we have known that. But until tonight, we had no idea of just how far beyond the call of duty these two men went. And again, you will be learning this right now for the very first time only on \"360.\"\nWe got new reporting as well on why the assault on the night of September 11th was so deadly to ambassador Stevens and computer technician Sean Smith even though they were holed up inside of what was supposed to be a fortified part of the consulate compound. The attackers we have now learned doused the building's exterior with diesel fuel, killing Smith and Stevens with dense toxic smoke. And there's yet more we're learning about the attack tonight as well as other late developments out of Benghazi. A large pro-democracy march on the headquarters of an extremist Islamic group in Benghazi.\nFirst though, the breaking news about how the two former Seals perished and how far they went to save other American lives.\nJoining us now to flesh out her exclusive reporting, CNN contributor and former homeland security advisor, Fran Townsend. Fran currently serves on the CIA external advisory committee and recently visited Libya with her employer, McAndrews & Forbes. Also with us, CNN's Arwa Damon, who has been breaking news all week for us from Benghazi.\nSo Fran, what have we learned about these two Navy Seals? Initially a former Seals, it was thought they were there to protect the ambassador. That turns out not the case.\nFRAN TOWNSEND, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR: That's not the case, Anderson. They are part of this protective security contractor force. These two contractors -- the contractors generally are recruited from elite special forces because of their training and experience. In the case of Glen Doherty, he had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. These were both men who understood very well the dangers, the trouble and how to respond to it appropriately, but they were not -- they were there but not with the ambassador's security detail. They coordinated and de-conflicted with the ambassador's detail. They also coordinated with Libyans. Their presence was not a secret. But they were there, frankly, at the annex with others as part of a much larger team to provide security.\nCOOPER: And there were two structures, this annex that we're learning about, it seems like there was an ambush there. I mean, the second attack on the annex seemed to have been an ambush.\nTOWNSEND: You know, it's not really clear what the parameters of that were. So what happens is, you have to appreciate, you talked about Glen and Tyrone being heroes. They are at the annex, the annex is secure, the perimeter is secure, they're not taking any fire. That's the area of their primary responsibility. They get a phone call that their colleagues over at the consulate are taking fire, that it's chaotic and they need help. They leave the security of their -- the annex compound and they run in the direction of the firefight.\nWhat they do there is they round up all of the consulate staff. That includes Americans, foreign service nationals, it includes everybody working at the consulate. It also included regrettably at that time the body of Sean Smith. They can't find the ambassador but they must he evacuate because they can no longer help defend the consulate and they take all these people to the much smaller annex where they secure them and they are there trying, figuring they are not taking fire there.\nIt's not clear how the assault begins, what causes it, whether or not they were set up and ambushed or followed there. The sources I have been talking to, it is not -- hopefully that comes out in if investigation.\nCOOPER: And Arwa, you say that particular attack, the one on the second site, involved even heavy artillery.\nARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's what we are hearing on the ground here, Anderson. The attack that took place, the second attack was a much more intense attack than what was initially seen at the consulate, although much shorter in duration. Some of the military officials we're talking to here were saying that they were using rocket propelled grenades. One was even saying that they were using mortar fire and that the rounds impacted pretty much immediately and for anyone who knows how mortar calibration works.\nIt's pretty rare that you would be able to hit your target the first time you do try to attempt to hit it with a mortar. But we are hearing here that the second attack most certainly was more intense and involved more fire power than the first time around and that is why Libyan government officials are saying that they believe that this was a pre-planned strike. Perhaps not necessarily to be timed with September 11th, but that most certainly the extremists that carried out this assault had planned it, perhaps they shelved the plans and then had seen a target of opportunity to strike, and strike they did as we now know.\nCOOPER: And Arwa, you were talking about the annex. Back to the main compound where the first fighting or gunfire took place, U.S. officials have insisted that the attackers hijacked a protest going on over the anti-Muslim movie. But Libyan witnesses are telling you a very different story. The \"New York times\" reported today that the front of the compound was completely quiet before the initial attack, no protests. What are you hearing?\nDAMON: That's what we heard days ago, Anderson, from a number of witnesses, including one of the guards who was at the main gate to the compound at one of those main gates. He said that the situation was calm, it was quiet, and suddenly he heard voices growing increasingly louder, chanting \"God is great\" and then he says the attack began simultaneously from three different directions.\nAnother eyewitness on the scene that we spoke to as well, the gardener, also confirming that report. And a number of other individuals we have been talking to, saying around 9:30, heavily armed men appeared around the compound and that shortly thereafter at around 10:00, the assault itself began, Anderson.\nCOOPER: And Fran, we have been reporting about differ reports on security at the main compound. Last night we reported that security was actually beefed up there. You're hearing new information as well.\nTOWNSEND: That's right. Consistent with the \"New York Times\" story, Anderson, there were five armed Americans and four armed Libyans. That was the beefed-up presence. You can question whether or not given what the history in that area had been, was that enough, and remember, that does not include the armed personnel, security, professional security personnel at the annex so you would also have had them to fall back on which of course they did have to do.\nCOOPER: You also have new reporting on diesel fuel, which was apparently poured around the compound where the ambassador was and Mr. Smith was.\nTOWNSEND: That's right. Look, any sort of fuel would have caused, you know, accelerated the fire. Diesel was particularly unfortunate -- an unfortunate accelerant because of course what happens there, there's this acrid, thick, very black smoke and we understand that's how they lost sight of the ambassador, they couldn't find him, and probably contributed to the fact that he and Sean smith died of asphyxiation.\nCOOPER: Rise up before around the compound. That's probably an overstatement. We don't know -- around the consulate, around the structure that the ambassador was in.\nCOOPER: Arwa, during protests there in Benghazi today, tens of thousands in particular on the streets protesting against the extremist militia some say was involved in the attacks on the compound. Protesters actually stormed the group's headquarters later in the day. What can you tell us about this and what's happening?\nDAMON: Well, earlier in the day we had this massive pro- democracy demonstration that did in fact take place and following that at around 10:00 at night, hundreds of these individuals went to the headquarters of a known militant extremist group here. And remember, the Libyan government says that it has detained some individuals from that organization in association with this attack. It was in fact the attack on the consulate that really was the catalyst for these demonstrations but then the catalyst for these individuals to go out and try to retake the compound, and they were saying retake the city from the hands of the extremists.\nAnd at the compound itself, was really quite the sense of euphoria, people saying that they were the ones that began this revolution in Benghazi, that they were going to be the ones who were going to take their city back. They were actually apologizing to America, saying that this is the real Libya. The Libyans who are going out trying to regain control of their own cities, trying to implement the democracy that they fought so hard for.\nBut then things took a very sinister turn because the second location that they struck, in fact, ended up being the headquarters of a battalion that has been legitimized by the government. The government took to the air waves trying to convince these individuals to back off that and other various compounds saying that it was Gadhafi loyalists trying to capitalize on the euphoria of the crowd to try to move them towards these other units that were in fact under the control of the government, that were in fact loyal to the government in and of itself.\nWe were at one of these locations, some pretty intense gunfire. We are hearing that over a dozen people were wounded and it just goes to underscore how chaotic and how volatile the situation here really is. And of course, how easily manipulated.\nCOOPER: Arwa Damon in Benghazi, be careful. Fran, thank you very much.\nOn Wednesday of this week, we reported that a source familiar with ambassador Stevens' thinking said in the months before his death, ambassador Stevens talked about being worried about what he called the never-ending security threats in Benghazi.\nWe also reported that the ambassador specifically mentioned the rise in Islamic extremism, the growing Al Qaeda presence in Libya and said he was on an Al Qaeda hit list. The information for that report like all of CNN's reporting was carefully vetted. Some of that information was found in a personal journal of ambassador Stevens in his handwriting.\nWe came upon the journal through our reporting and notified the family. At their request, we returned that journal to them. We reported what we found newsworthy in the ambassador's writings. A reporter followed up on what we found newsworthy in the ambassador's writings.\nLet us know what you think. We're on facebook. You can follow me on twitter @andersonooper. I'm tweeting tonight.\nUp next, the attack's political fallout here at home. Has President Obama's handling of it given Mitt Romney an opening? Have governor Romney's statements hurt his caused. Fareed Zakaria, Jessica Yellin and Jim Acosta join us.\nCOOPER: Welcome back. More on Libya now as our breaking news was unfolding today. New details about the killings in Benghazi and the rioting and chaos that followed a pro-democracy march today in Benghazi. A number of the protesters are burning cars, taking over the headquarters of an extremist militia group that the government suspects of involvement in last week's assault. It began peacefully with marchers outnumbering a much smaller crowd of religious radicals. Many carried pro-America signs including some demanding justice for ambassador Christopher Stevens.\nBack home, pursuing that notion has neither been simple, nor easy, nor untouched by election year politics. It began early on with Mitt Romney's late night claim that the administration's first response was to sympathize with the attackers. That was not the case.\nBut the White House's subsequent line downplaying terrorism as a factor, to many that strained credibility. Late this week the administration backed down from that position while dismissing the notion that they're backing down.\nVICTORIA NULAND, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN: It's as everybody who has spoken to any of these details has said starting with what we said here, what everybody along the way has said. The information we have given to date is based on initial assessments. We have given you all kinds of caveats, including from here, that the investigation was going to have to tell us the complete and final story.\nCOOPER: That investigation is ongoing. Yesterday behind closed doors, senior defense intelligence and law enforcement officials briefed members of Congress. Today, though, and for the next month and a half this tragedy is being and will be hashed out as well in the public eye, especially out on the campaign trail.\nJoining me now is Fareed Zakaria, hot of CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS.\" He's got Bill Clinton on his program this week. Also Jim Acosta, traveling with the Romney campaign and Jessica Yellin at the White House.\nJessica, let's start with you at the White House. They have been very cautious in dealing with this. Really only one brief statement from the president. It took about a week and a half for them to call the incident in Benghazi a terrorist act. Is there any indication we are going to be hearing more directly from the president about this any time soon?\nJESSICA YELLIN, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Anderson. I would expect that we will hear from the president on this when he addresses the U.N. general assembly next week, both about the specifics of the attack in Libya and the unrest in the Middle East more broadly.\nThey don't have a lot to gain to be just crassly political about it. From talking to -- talking too much about it until they have more facts. Because he is going to the U.N. next week, he will have the big world stage so it's a natural opportunity for him to address it. Look for it there.\nCOOPER: Well I mean, Jessica, is there a caution on talking about it out of not wanting to, you know, is it an understandable desire to gather intelligence, figure out exactly what happened, or is it politics?\nYELLIN: Look, it's both. They have had problems in the past when they have jumped too quickly. Remember after Osama bin Laden's raid and they came out with a series of facts and that was a positive scenario for them and the facts in that case weren't exactly right so they've learned get the facts straight before you come out publicly.\nOn the politics of it, Anderson, they don't really have anything to gain. Mitt Romney has handed them so many openings on this one, he's botched his response on Libya. There's no political upside for the president to weigh in. He just needs to be presidential on this.\nCOOPER: Fareed, we did see some dip in poll numbers on foreign policy in the wake of this. Do you think, do these attacks hurt the president in terms of foreign policy?\nFAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: I don't think so, but I think the president is making a mistake if he's entirely silent. As Jessica says, the obvious place would be the U.N. general assembly.\nLook, most Americans, much of the world is trying to figure out what does all this mean, and what does it mean for our presence in Afghanistan, what does it mean for outreach to the Muslim world.\nThe president has an extraordinary opportunity to be as Bill Clinton was during the Democratic National Convention, an explainer, kind of explainer in chief. I think it helps him politically because most crises, Jimmy Carter is the exception, most crises make a president look presidential. He gets the stage, he gets to speak in serious terms, he has all the gravitas. The other guys out there taking pot shots but he is on the campaign trail and the president is the president.\nCOOPER: Jim, we also have Romney seemed to actually lose ground on the foreign policy issue in the wake of the incident. Is there any sense in the campaign that this is ground the governor has to try to make up in the foreign policy sphere, even though his focus has been on the economy?\nJIM ACOSTA, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I had a chance to talk to a senior Romney advisor about this. And he said about the Benghazi attack and the administration's response to it. But they would like to see what he called more clarity from the administration when it comes to what exactly happened, what led up to the deaths of those American diplomats in Libya. But I think the campaign also acknowledges, Anderson, that they have had a rough couple of weeks, starting with that initial statement on what happened in Libya and Egypt. Mitt Romney clearly spoke before all of the facts came in, and then as you saw what happened this week with his hidden camera video leaked to \"Mother Jones,\" they were put on the defensive over economic issues.\nCOOPER: Jessica, we did see ambassador Susan Rice at the U.N. saying that -- I mean, indicating, not really talking about this in terms of being a terrorist attack. It was days later the terrorist attack part of this was really discussed.\nIs there concern in the Obama campaign this controversy might be providing Republicans some fodder to put a chink in the president's foreign policy armor?\nYELLIN: Well, not yet. I mean, not given Romney's response so far, which was not handled well, Anderson. But the larger potential here is that if there is another attack on Americans in another country or in Libya, if this grows in some way, that's the real danger for the president. Because his strength in foreign policy is really about the perception that he is a decisive and clear leader, and that's what voters, it's perceived that voters are responding to. If world events seem to be spinning out of his control, then that leadership quality could erode for him. But we're not at that stage yet and so the campaign is not reflecting any kind of anxiety on that front at this moment.\nCOOPER: It is interesting, Fareed, that a loss for the president in the foreign policy sphere does not necessarily translate to a victory for the Romney campaign in the foreign policy realm because of the way they've handled all this stuff.\nZAKARIA: But the crucial part is what you said last. Because of the way they've handled it. Generally speaking, a loss for the president does translate into a gain. Think of again Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan was seen as wildly inexperienced and kind of somewhat crazy on foreign policy, somewhat radical. Once Carter started having trouble, the Iran hostage crisis, the soviet invasion of Afghanistan, all Reagan had to show was that he was stable, that he was, you know, he wasn't going to blow up the world, and he benefited.\nCOOPER: I should also point out, Reagan did not politicize that event. He basically put out a statement as I recall, you know, saying we stand behind -- we're all one.\nZAKARIA: Exactly. He could see that bad news was hurting the president. He didn't need to do very much to pile on. I think that in this case, because Romney has been inept, it hasn't really translated much. I agree with Jessica, if something else were to happen, it might change that, but Obama again, if he gets out ahead of it, because really, these have not been events where people feel as though the United States is under attack, under siege. There is a feeling that something is spinning out of control in the Middle East and we need to understand it.\nCOOPER: Fareed, thank you. Jim Acosta, Jessica Yellin.\nBe sure to tune in Sunday night, 8:00 and 11:00. as Fareed has a really fascinating special. Global lessons, putting America to work right her on CNN.\nIt has been a crucial week for Mitt Romney in the wake of his 47 percent comments. Will the release of his 2011 tax returns help change the conversation.. Has it already? Will it put any question about his finances to rest? James Carville, Mary Matalin spare ahead.\nCOOPER: What happened aboard Ann Romney's jet and how the crew handled it, ahead in the program.\nCOOPER: Welcome back. We're all politics now. Mitt Romney's campaign released his 2011 tax returns today. You probably heard that. Showing he made $13.7 million last year in mostly investment income, and paid an effective tax rate of 14.1 percent. Now, the campaign also released a letter from the accounting firm price Waterhouse coopers saying the Romneys paid taxes every year from 1990 to 2009 at an effective tax rate of at least 13.6 percent each year. That information obviously contradicts what Senate majority leader Harry Reid has been claiming about Romney for more than a month now.\nSEN. HARRY REID (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER: The word's out that he hasn't paid any taxes for ten years. Let him prove that he has paid taxes, because he hasn't.\nCOOPER: Oh, when Harry Reid said the word is out, the thing is that Reid himself was the one who put the word out. He's the one who made the accusation in the first place. Turned out he didn't have any proof of his own. At least he hasn't offered any. He said a source was an investor of Bain Capital, Romney's investment firm, an unnamed source.\nNow, you might think that tonight in the face of the letter from Romney's accounting firm, senator Reid might retract his earlier claim. Instead he released this statement. Quote, \"the information released today reveals that Mitt Romney manipulated one of two years of tax returns he has seen fit to show the American people and then only to conform with his public statements. That raises the question what else in those returns has Romney manipulated.\"\nReid is talking about the fact that the Romneys actually paid more taxes than required in 2011. The Romneys' didn't claim all their charitable deductions since 2011 because they wanted to make sure their tax rate didn't fall below 13 percent, the minimum rate that Romney has said he paid over the last decade. You can decide for yourself about the amounts of manipulation.\nJoining me is CNN political contributors Mary Matalin and James Carville.\nSo James, is that manipulation?\nJAMES CARVILLE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Look, this is the best day Romney's had all month. Of course it's manipulation and of course he can file after the election and get the refund which is totally legal and he has always said that he paid the minimal amount of taxes so all of a sudden, the milk of human kindness comes from Mitt Romney and he's going to give the federal government money that he doesn't owe. I don't know of any other explanation. Maybe somebody can come up with one.\nCOOPER: I think Mary might be able to. Mary?\nMATALIN: I just want to get this straight. So now what the complaint from my liberal friends is that Romney gave 30 percent of his income last year to charity and over the course of the many, many years that he's paid 100 percent of his taxes in direct contradiction of Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader calling him a felon and a scofflaw and a tax cheat, he's paid 100 percent of his rate, he's been 20 percent of his income over those 20 years to charity, and there's something wrong with that. If they said if he could prove that he could walk on water, they would complain because he couldn't swim.\nCARVILLE: Again, I think the point you were making was, is that he didn't take charitable deductions because he said his tax rate was 13 percent and that would have driven it below it and he can do it after. Like I say, this guy has done 13 events in 20 days. He doesn't, you know, he thinks he's above releasing his tax returns like everybody else so this stops the story about the 47 percent of all of those things he's done. So all in all for him, even though the story is bad, it's probably the best story he's gotten all month.\nCOOPER: So, you think they released it today in order to try to change the narrative?\nCOOPER: It is a Friday afternoon, though, which is sort of when you do the document dump.\nMATALIN: But it was done today, they asked for the extension. He price Waterhouse Cooper, whatever they are, unless you want -- if Harry Reid wants to call them liars, scofflaws, felons and tax cheats, why doesn't he malign and libel everyone in the country.\nI think this is a good story. I don't think it's a data dump. I think it's done, it's exactly what he said, it's more generous than anyone - that anybody we know and anyone could have expected. And the real story where people are really concerned about is the Middle East and beyond, is completely melting down and after a week of denying it, this president finally fessed-up that it was a terrorist attack.\nWe've had a serious terrorist attack and we're less secure than we were. That's what presidential campaigns are going to be about, not Mitt Romney's 20 years of generous charitable giving and complete 100 percent tax completions.\nCARVILLE: OK. The fact remains that he did that, he said it was 13. The fact when he ran for governor of Massachusetts said he filed in Massachusetts return and then later had to fess up that he really didn't. I don't believe anything Mitt Romney says on his taxes, to be honest with you.\nMATALIN: Are you calling him a liar?\nCARVILLE: I don't believe -- he did before when he was filing in Massachusetts, told people he filed in Massachusetts and didn't. He said he paid 13 percent in taxes.\nHe had to manipulate his tax return to not take charitable deduction to do that. That's his history. I don't think on his taxes he's been very forthcoming. He will only give us two years of them.\nCOOPER: Mary, critics of Romney will say look, we know, you know, they've released the information that he's given years of money to charities, but not what he's actually paid in taxes over the years. Why is it OK to give, you know, that information on charities and yet not -- why wouldn't he just give out his taxes?\nMATALIN: He's released decades of financial disclosure, everything that the law requires. He's paid all his taxes, 100 percent and more than the law requires, which actually I do think is kind of weird.\nHe's given millions and millions, scores of millions of dollars to charity. We're going to try to make this into a negative? I just don't see how this turns into a negative story unless we're completely detached from reality.\nAnd the reality that is the everyday life of voters who are not voting on Romney's tax returns which are now complete and for them to judge for themselves how charitable and legal he is, or do they want to care about their own taxes which will be going up if this president's re-elected.\nCOOPER: James, Mary raises a good point. You've seen Harry Reid's response. He says these returns raise more questions about Mitt Romney's finances, but the fact is, the evidence out there suggests the senator was wrong, that Reid was wrong when he claimed that Romney had paid no taxes for 10 years. There's no evidence of that.\nCARVILLE: Well, look, he said I'm sure we're going to get this guy's name before it's over, the offshore Cayman Islands, Swiss bank account deal that Romney was in, and that he didn't pay any taxes. That's what he was basing it on.\nWe only see two years of tax returns, by the way. That's all we see. He's paying 12 percent of the federal tax where a hotel may had paid 15 percent in federal taxes.\nSo he won't be -- he won't tell us what his tax returns are prior to this. He has a history of putting out false information about tax returns when he ran for governor of Massachusetts.\nSo I think there are a lot of doubts that are raised here but after you call 47 percent of the people in the United States slackers, there's not much more you can do to sort of hurt yourself, to be honest with you.\nMATALIN: It's not what he said. And now they want to libel an iconic American accounting firm, Price Waterhouse Cooper, been around forever. They're just going to libel everybody in their way.\nSo let's take down all of our big institutions, everything that's iconic in this country in pursuit of Obama's re-election. You sound insane.\nCOOPER: What is it like living with you two?\nMATALIN: Friday night, if we weren't with you, we would probably be having a good stiff drink, which we're about to go do right now.\nCOOPER: I'll let you go do that. Mary, thank you. James Carville, thank you.\nCOOPER: I would like to join them.\nAs we said, it's been a pretty rough week for the Romney campaign and the shots are not just coming from Democrats. In a blog post Tuesday, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist Peggy Noonan wrote it's time to admit the Romney campaign is an incompetent one, not big, not brave, not thoughtfully tackling great issues and intervention is in order.\nMitt, this isn't working. Today, she doubled down writing the Romney campaign has to get turned around. This week, I called it incompetent but only because I was being polite. I really meant rolling calamity. Noonan is not alone.\nOther high profile Republicans are also calling for a campaign reboot. In the face of all this, not so friendly fire, Ann Romney is now returning fire. Here's Randi Kaye.\nRANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ann Romney has a message for what she calls the chattering class Republicans criticizing her husband.\nANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY: Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it, get in the ring. This is hard. You know, it's an important thing that we're doing right now and it's an important election.\nAnd it is time for all Americans to realize how significant this election is and how lucky we are to have someone with Mitt's qualifications and experience and know-how to be able to have the opportunity to run this country.\nKAYE: In another interview, she defended her husband over the now famous 47 percent tape.\nROMNEY: You know, I know the guy. I know him really well. I know he cares and that's why we're running. So it's unfortunate when something gets misinterpreted like this or is taken out of context.\nIt's nonsense. I don't let it sink in. You hear it and then you just let it go right by. And you're used to it, honestly at this point, I'm not surprised by anything.\nKAYE (on camera): To those who know her, Mrs. Romney's attitude is nothing new. It has always been Ann to the rescue. In the Romney household, she is often called the trusted advisor and the Mitt stabilizer. But first and foremost, she is the great protector of all things Romney.\n(voice-over): Ron Scott, who has known Mitt Romney since 1985 and wrote a book about him, says Ann is no pushover.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The last person on earth you would want to cross would be Ann Romney. If you go after one of her kids or after her husband, she's going to be there.\nKAYE: She hoped to help America embrace her husband.\nROMNEY: I know this good and decent man for what he is. He's warm and loving and patient. He has tried to live his life with a set of values centered on family, faith and love of one's fellow man. From the time we were first married, I've seen him spend countless hours helping others. KAYE: Yet no matter how much she builds him up, Team Romney can't seem to catch a break. Listen to what she told Neil Cavuto on Fox.\nROMNEY: As you know we always feel like we're getting picked on more than anyone else. It's just what happens.\nNEIL CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS: You think the media's fair to you?\nROMNEY: That is going to get me in trouble if I answer that honestly.\nKAYE: With the campaign calendar ticking down, the race may very well come down to the three presidential debates. Ann Romney says she knows the stakes. As she always has, trusts her husband will get the job done. Once again, Ann Romney will be in her husband's corner.\nROMNEY: I feel like my best advice is just to bring peace and calm to him and just trust in him and say I know you can do it.\nKAYE: Randi Kaye, CNN, Atlanta.\nCOOPER: As we mentioned earlier, Ann Romney had a bit of an airborne scare today. We just got an air traffic control audio from the incident. That's ahead.\nAlso, police in Colorado find an arrest -- they arrest an alleged bank robber, but end up stopping 19 cars in the process, holding teenagers at gun point, putting a lot of innocent people in handcuffs. Did they go too far? That's the question tonight in \"Crime and Punishment\" next.\nCOOPER: Guns pointed at mothers, young children and teenagers as police search for a bank robbery suspect. They say they got their man, but could he get away with it because police went too far in the manhunt? \"Crime and Punishment\" next.\nCOOPER: \"Crime and Punishment\" tonight. A bank robbery case in Colorado is raising serious questions about how far police can go to catch the bad guy.\nNow in the process of stopping traffic to find and arrest an alleged bank robber, police also held innocent civilians at gun point. Now the whole case against the alleged robber could be in jeopardy because of it. Ted Rowlands reports.\nTED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Marci Strandberg stopped at a light on her way home from shopping near Denver, Colorado. Next thing she knew, police had her at gun point.\nMARCI STRANDBERG, CAUGHT IN POLICE BLOCKADE: I said I have kids in my car, and that rifle's pointed right at me.\nROWLANDS: Nineteen cars were held at this intersection that Saturday afternoon. Everyone was ordered out of their cars at gun point including children. The boy in the green shirt is 16-year-old Michael Hance.\nMICHAEL HANCE, 16-YEAR-OLD: They had rifles, guns and everything pointed at me with shields and a canine dog.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A robbery just occurred with a gun at Wells Fargo.\nROWLANDS: Police were looking for this bank robber seen here wearing a beekeeper's mask and armed with an air horn and loaded gun. He had just made off with $25,000 from a Wells Fargo a few miles away.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Last seen wearing a beehive mask.\nROWLANDS (on camera): Police thought the bank robber was at this intersection because there was a GPS tracking device hidden in with the money. The problem is, they had no idea what car he could be in and because of that beekeeper's mask. They didn't even know what he looks like.\n(voice-over): So everyone was treated as an armed and dangerous suspect.\nSTRANDBERG: We all had to have our hands showing and our arms out the window and we had to keep our arms like this.\nROWLANDS: One by one, police approached each car with guns and shields, nearly everyone was handcuffed. Marci's 4-year-old daughter who you can see she's carrying was asleep for most of the ordeal. Her 8-year-old son, however, was awake.\nSTRANDBERG: My son was crying and I kept telling him to keep his head down between his legs because I didn't know if open fire was going to happen.\nROWLANDS: That's Crystal Deguzman in handcuffs moments after she watched police take her son, 16-year-old, Michael, away at gun point.\nCRYSTAL DEGUZMAN, CAUGHT IN POLICE BLOCKADE: I think any mom would be upset. Not knowing what's going to happen to your kid.\nROWLANDS: Police eventually searched this white expedition. Inside, they found two loaded guns, the money and the beekeeper's mask.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They have a suspect in custody.\nROWLANDS: The 45-year-old Christian Pache, a school teacher with no criminal record, was arrested and charged with armed robbery. He's pled not guilty.\nWas this a case of good police work, or did they go too far? Federal law gives police some leeway to detain citizens for a reasonable period of time as part of a criminal investigation.\nDAVID LANE, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: A little bit of inconvenience, you know, getting cuffed for a minute to see if you're armed, getting detained very briefly to see if there's some probable cause to believe you've done something. You do have to put up with that, but two hours at rifle point, I think that's a little excessive.\nCHIEF DAN OATES, AURORA POLICE DEPARTMENT: No question we inconvenienced citizens. We feel badly about that. We apologize to them, but we've made a tough choice here and we arrested a very dangerous armed bank robber.\nROWLANDS: But what police did may have put the entire case in jeopardy. The accused robber's attorney says there was no probable cause to search the vehicle, and that police violated his client's rights by pressuring him to agree to a search after he initially refused.\nIf a judge agrees, all of the evidence, the guns, the money, the beekeeper's mask, could be thrown out because of the way it was collected, and as crazy as that sounds, some legal experts say they have an argument.\nTim Olson, who was among those handcuffed at the intersection, says that would send a message to police.\nTIM OLSON, CAUGHT IN POLICE BLOCKADE: If the bank robber gets away with it, that says you didn't do your job properly.\nROWLANDS: The judge's ruling in the case should indicate whether police were doing their job or if they crossed the line. Ted Rowlands, CNN, Aurora, Colorado.\nSome tense moments also in Pittsburgh today, a former U.S. soldier allegedly took a man hostage for several hours. Details on that ahead.\nCOOPER: A lawsuit over a 4-year-old's playhouse is just ahead on the \"Ridiculist.\" But first, Isha is here with the \"360 Bulletin\" -- Isha.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have an electrical issue here and we are going to declare an emergency. We will probably need assistance here. We got smoke in the cabin. We're going to see the severity of it. We'll let you know. We're going to request fire trucks, please.\nSESAY: As you heard, the cabin filled with smoke during the flight. No one was injured.\nAcross Syria today, at least 117 people were killed, according to opposition activists. They claimed 15 people died in Aleppo province and they say 17 others were stabbed to death by government troops in a Damascus suburb.\nPolice say an armed man who took a hostage inside a downtown Pittsburgh office building today surrendered peacefully. The suspect talked to family members as well as negotiators during the standoff. The hostage was not harmed.\nA \"360\" follow, three Saginaw, Michigan police officers punished in their role for the shooting and killing of a homeless man, an incident caught on tape. One officer was demoted. A police official didn't reveal how the other two were disciplined after a ten-week investigation. Prosecutors said they would not pursue criminal charges in the case.\nAnderson, the space shuttle \"Endeavour\" made its final flight today over California atop a modified Boeing 747 jet. The retired \"Endeavour\" will go on display at the California Science Center in L.A.\nSESAY: Very cool. But I have to say, so you weren't here yesterday.\nSESAY: Did you hear about this?\nCOOPER: I did hear a little bit about it.\nSESAY: Turned up on the show, had some pretty strong words for you with your whole \"Ridiculist\" thing. I know you're not just going to take it. He even renamed the \"Ridiculist.\"\nCOOPER: Yes, what did he call it?\nSESAY: The re-blitzulist. COOPER: It doesn't have the same flowing off the tongue. He was annoyed about me saying that he had copied my rad style with the glasses?\nSESAY: In the interest of full disclosure, I feel I have to tell you that I did say to him on the air that he looked kind of hot in his glasses.\nCOOPER: You've called me a geek, you've said I, you know, you made all sorts of disparaging remarks about me in our many years together and yet he's here for one night, and he's hot?\nSESAY: Don't be like that.\nSESAY: We've got a special thing, you know.\nCOOPER: We used to. We used to have a special thing.\nSESAY: You look kind of hot with your glasses, too.\nCOOPER: Please. I don't want your sloppy seconds. I want to clean up for Blitzer over here.\nSESAY: Fine. Be like that.\nCOOPER: Time now for the shot, a close encounter with a cheetah in Kenya. The big cat apparently wanted a closer look at a jeep. The tourists inside, she took her time checking it out, hanging out for several minutes, even lying down at one point just inches from the tourist sitting in the jeep. Take a look at this.\nSESAY: That is some scary stuff.\nSESAY: Constantly calling out Neil.\nCOOPER: He's intrepid. He gets right in there and the tiger was not happy about it.\nSESAY: Not as hot as you, though.\nCOOPER: Have a good weekend.\nComing up, a homeowners association, got to see this \"Ridiculist,\" that's next. We'll be right back.\nCOOPER: Time now for the \"Ridiculist.\" Tonight, we are issuing a nationwide plea for a return to sanity, end to the madness once and for all. Now we all know that people like to put stuff in their yards, your garden gnomes, flags emblazoned with professional sports logos, Homer Simpson dressed as Santa Claus, what have you.\nBut there has to be a limit. When someone puts something undeniably offensive in their backyard there has to be repercussions. That's why I'm proud to report that in Georgia, one very brave and heroic homeowners association has finally, finally taken a stand and filed a lawsuit over this pink playhouse.\nI mean, would you just take a look at that thing? Hideous eyesore, party of one, your table is ready. Forget the fact that you can't even see it from the front of the house, you have to peek around the house and into the backyard.\nThe homeowners association knows it is there and they know it's pink. The first rule of homeowners association, don't talk about homeowners association. The second rule, no unapproved colors on free-standing backyard structures.\nThat isn't even taking into account the activity that occurs within said structure. Yes, take a look.\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Put it in the oven.\nCOOPER: Yes. That would be 4-year-old, Aubrey. She's probably having a tea party, probably without a permit. Of course, she isn't pulling this off all on her own. No, there's her accomplice slash grandmother, who built the play house as a Christmas present.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought this is ridiculous. There's too much crime and everything else. These lawyers need to be worrying about other things that are way more important than whether or not my granddaughter has a pink play house or not.\nCOOPER: I want to apologize for using this. I have never done that before. There has been some public outcry about this, but the president of the homeowners association is standing firm. Take it away.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Part of approval is the color. We didn't disapprove the play house. We've disapproved the color.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You think the color pink is worth this whole legal mess?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Obviously it is. Obviously, I had neighbors that complained about it.\nCOOPER: OK, you really need to get other things going on in your life. Totally reasonable, though, sounds like the lawsuit would go away if they just painted the play house and why not?\nWhat could possibly be more thrilling for a little girl than to suddenly find the pink play house that she loves magically transformed into a really fun shade of, I don't know, dirt brown?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You like it pink?\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD: It's my favorite color.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Would you want your play house brown?\nCOOPER: I rest my case. The grandmother has two weeks to respond to the lawsuit and it sounds like she is in it for the long haul.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm going to fight it until the bitter end. I will not paint that dollhouse. I will move first.\nCOOPER: I think it was John Mellencamp who said it best, isn't that America, home of the free little pink houses for you and me, except for you little Aubrey, sorry. Yours has to look like a shed. So thank you, John Mellencamp, and thank you, homeowners association, for reminding us what really matters on the \"Ridiculist.\"\nThat does it for us. We'll see you again one hour from now at 10:00 p.m. Eastern, another edition of \"360.\"",
        "Another vessel is seized as ordeal of captured American captain continues.\nThe hijacking is the latest in a series of raids in the region. At least a dozen ships have been seized off the Somali coast, with more than 200 crew members being held hostage.\nSomali pirates have continued to operate despite the presence of an international task force gathered to defend shipping in what is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.\nThe capture of the tugboat comes a day after another group of Somali pirates recaptured Richard Phillips, an American sailor, when he tried to escape from the lifeboat in which he is being held hostage.\nPhillips had jumped into the water on Friday and tried to swim towards the USS Bainbridge, a nearby destroyer.\nHe was seized off the coast of Somalia after an abortive attempt on Wednesday by the pirates to hijack his ship, the Maersk Alabama, which was carrying 5,000 tonnes of UN aid for African refugees.\nThe vessel arrived in the Kenyan port of Mombasa at 17:30 GMT on Saturday without Phillips.\nAbdi Gara, a pirate commander, said on Friday that Phillips would be moved from the lifeboat to another ship off the Somali coast.\nOnly four pirates are guarding him on the lifeboat, but transfer to a larger ship would make it easier for them to thwart any US military attempt to free him.\nUS navy forces have been pouring into the region amid the standoff over Phillips.\nGarad warned that any attempt to free Phillips would be disastrous.\n\"I'm afraid this matter is likely to create disaster because it's taking too long and we are getting information that the Americans are planning rescue tricks like the French commandos did,\" he said.\nGarad was referring to storming on Friday by French marine commandos of the Tanit, a yacht, in which Florent Lemacon, a French yachtsman, and two pirates died.\nThe pirates were taking the Tanit in towards the Somali coast and had refused offers of a ransom, a spokesman for French President Nicolas Sarkozy said.\nFour hostages, including Lemacon's three-year-old son, walked free and three pirates were captured as a result of the raid.\nMohamud Muse Hirsi, the president of Somalia's autonomous Puntland region, said giving in to the pirates' demands is not an option.\n\"We do not advocate for any ransom to be paid to the pirates and we support the French government, which uses force, while taking on the pirates,\" he said.\nPuntland is reputed to be the home of many pirates.\nVessels captured by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden are said to fetch on average a ransom of $2 million.\nAli Abdullahi, a security consultant and risk management analyst specialising on Somalia, said the only way to tackle piracy is to address the political and economic problems there.\n\"A lot of the time, we're not talking about the core issues which have made piracy a major event in Somalia,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\"There has been a lot of illegal fishing by international agents, toxic dump wasting on parts of Somalia, a lack of bad governance as well, all of which are the real causes of piracy.\"",
        "ANSWER: I will lower property taxes. We pay the highest property taxes in the U.S. I have lowered property taxes in local government.\nI will repeal the income tax hike. Families are struggling to make ends meet. My opponent just raised income taxes on them by 32%.\nI will support core services for those truly in need.\nEnd Madigan\u2019s corrupt one-party system.\nANSWER: All new and recent employees in 401 K plans.\nIncrease age when eligible except with police and fire.\nChange the yearly cost of living increase to CPI from the current 3%.\nIntend to make good on promises made unless money runs out and state becomes financially insolvent.\nTaxpayers need to be treated fairly and not driven out of the state by the costs of unfunded and unrealistic pension promises.\nAll new and recent employees in 401 K plans.\nChange the yearly cost of living increase to CPI.\nQUESTION: Cook County and Chicago are on their way to paying a $13 hourly minimum wage. Many suburbs in the county, however, have opted out of the wage increase. Should Illinois raise its minimum wage from $8.25 an hour?\nANSWER: No. Increasing minimum wage destroys jobs. Best way to increases workers wages is to reduce taxes and allow small businesses to thrive. Example is after the recent federal tax decrease many workers received wage increases and bonuses. Competition for workers in a growing economy raises wages naturally and further stimulates the economy.\nANSWER: No. It is a gate way drug. It does not have a net positive effect on society. Not opposed to medical use if indicated. I am not in favor of severe criminal penalties for use.\nQUESTION: Would you support more casinos in Illinois, including in Chicago? What about racinos? Please explain.\nI would not oppose but would not count on them to increase state revenue. They may have an entertainment and tourist value but could also be detrimental to compulsive gamblers.\nOn racinos: Same as above.\nANSWER: Not only would I freeze property taxes but I would reduce them. It is not that hard to do. I have done it. I would work toward a 1 % of a home\u2019s value property tax cap, which is the average in the US. In Illinois some home owners are paying more in property taxes than their mortgage payments. Those retired can\u2019t afford to stay in the home they rose their families in. It\u2019s not right.\nWith the rate people are fleeing Illinois we will have a difficult time supporting core services and pension obligations. If we lower property taxes, more people can afford to stay in Illinois resulting in more net revenue. More net revenue allows us to support those truly in need. Also, lower property taxes have been shown to increase home values. Homes are most people\u2019s nest egg.\nANSWER: The education funding bill recently approved is flawed. It allows Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to get the same or more money compared to a previous year even if there are fewer students enrolled. It unfairly deploys resources from the suburban schools to the CPS.\nANSWER: Huge and growing problem. 99 people die of opioid overdose per day in US. Growing in DuPage county. We have developed an opioid task force at Elmhurst Hospital. I have been educating our local community groups about our program. Awareness, Education, intervention, alternative therapies, family and community support and follow up are all essential ingredients to reducing and hopefully eliminating the opioid problem.\nANSWER: Silencers are not the main problem related to gun issues. Reducing the sound, a gun makes can reduce hearing loss for sportsmen. Not sure of the benefit to restrict them. Gun still makes a loud noise with them.\nANSWER: Yes, I think there needs to be reasonable checks to make sure guns cannot be purchased by those who will do harm to others with them.\nANSWER: Yes, I don\u2019t think the emotionally or mentally disturbed should even have guns.\nQUESTION: What would you do to ensure the long-term viability of the state\u2019s Medicaid program? Do you support continued Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act? Should the state continue on a path toward managed care for Medicaid beneficiaries?\nANSWER: More than 25 % of Illinoisans have Medicaid. That is too many for state taxpayers to afford to support. We need to reduce the expansion of Medicaid and limit it to those who truly need it. Should everyone be permitted to buy into Medicaid?\nOn Medicaid expansion: No. Many are abusing the system.\nOn managed care for Medicaid beneficiaries: Managed care done efficiently may increase quality and reduce costs in the long run. But has to be done right.\nShould everyone be permitted to buy into Medicaid? Everyone should have access to healthcare. Medicaid should be for those who are truly in need and have no other alternative.\nANSWER: Give Illinois students a bigger discount compared students coming from out of state. Not give tax payer funded subsidizes to illegal immigrants but give them instead to the children of Illinois residents. Give in-state students a preference at our in-state schools like other states do for their students. After all, their parents have been paying Illinois taxes their whole life and should get a benefit of an affordable, quality education for their kids.\nDoes Illinois have too many state universities? I would have to look at the numbers of Illinois students who want to attend in Illinois but can not because others from out of state have taken the available spots. I would do a cost analysis of our state universities. Education of the next generation is the most important job we have to preserve our future.\nQUESTION: Please list three of Gov.

        "Four Chinese University students have begun a 200-day experiment in which they will live in a simulated space station, isolated from the rest of the world and forced to survive using only the resources that they would find while living on another world, according to media reports.\nDubbed Lunar Palace 365, the experiment is taking place in Beijing and will force the students to obtain oxygen from plants grown in the facility, recycle their own urine into drinkable water, and to complete daily tasks in a station completely devoid of sunlight, explained Engadget.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve designed it so the oxygen (produced by plants at the station) is exactly enough to satisfy the humans, the animals, and the organisms that break down the waste materials,\u201d Liu Hong, a professor at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Beihang University) and the coordinator of the Lunar Palace 365 project, told Reuters on Sunday.\nWhile participants will be given a series of daily tasks to complete in order to keep them happy, students who were involved with a similar, shorter-length experiment to concluded recently told Reuters that they sometimes felt \u201ca bit low\u201d after finishing up their work for a given day.\nLast August, a similar project, the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) came to an end after participants spent a full year living in a simulated space station, according to Engadget. That NASA-backed initiative was deemed to be a success, showing that a group could continue to work together and be productive during an extended off-world stay.\nConducted atop the dome on Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Loa volcano, HI-SEAS was designed to show that astronauts could survive the mental and physical rigors of a mission to Mars. The crew members could only leave their living facility if they wore spacesuits, and they could only eat simple foods such as canned or powdered goods. It was like camping, but for a much longer period of time.\nExperiments like these are \u201cvital when it comes to picking crews, figuring out how people are going to actually work on different kinds of missions, and\u2026 the human factors element of space travel [and] colonization,\u201d Tristan Bassingthwaighte, a University of Hawaii at Manoa student who served as the architect for the HI-SEAS crew, said in a statement last August.\n\u201cI can give you my personal impression which is that a mission to Mars in the close future is realistic. I think the technological and psychological obstacles can be overcome,\u201d said Cyprien Verseux, a HI-SEAS crew member from France. Another HI-SEAS experiment began back in January but is only expected to last eight months, according to a university press release, and one has also been scheduled to take place in 2018.",

        "SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- As a symbol of national pride and success, South Korea and Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung, carries more weight on his shoulders than the need to perform.\nSouth Korea's Park Ji-Sung celebrates after at the 2006 World Cup against France.\nPark, once rejected from his country's own K-League, is now considered the ambassador of Korean football.\nA responsibility he seems to able carry. \"I want to push my way through Manchester United's star players and put my name on the list of the best 11 team.\n\"I want to show the world how good Korean players are by playing well in the top flight,\" Park wrote in his book \"Neverending Challenge\" before he joined United.\nPark's autobiography, which illustrates his life as a football player since he started out at the age of ten, became a bestseller after being published in 2006.\nIt is no surprise. Park is a celebrity in South Korea and is swamped with fans wherever he goes. His hometown, Suwon, near to Seoul, built a park and named a road after Park to commemorate him becoming the first Premier League-r in South Korean history.\nPark may even become the first Asian to win a Championship League medal after this season. Nicknamed \"Three-lung Park\" for his seemingly overflowing energy supply, the South Korean papers plaster their front pages with Park if he scores and give out the smallest details of how many minutes he ran in each match.\nBut Park's football career had not really drawn much attention until the recent years. He was mostly unknown to the public until he scored the winning goal to defeat Portugal in the 2002 World Cup in which South Korea reached the semifinals for the first time ever.\n\"People like him because there's a touching story behind him,\" football commentator Park Moon Sung at SBS, one of Korea's major broadcasters, said. \"They can see how this player, who never really got much attention, is maturing over the years.\"\nThe South Korea player, after receiving no calls from the K-League, started his professional career in Japan with Kyoto Purple in 2000. It was only after the 2002 World Cup that he joined PSV Eindhoven and proceeded to join Manchester United in 2005.\nPark has so far managed to keep his private life out of spotlight, most likely due to his quiet personality, a quality that is also reflected in his performances.\n\"He's someone who pumps energy into the entire team. He's not like a magician who can save the team from its worst moments with dazzling skills,\" the SBS commentator said.\n\"It's more like he plays for the others and brings the team together which is something very much needed in a team like Manchester United with all its stars.\"\nPark's joining of Manchester United has enriched the football culture in Korea. Many who started watching European games because of Park have now become avid fans.\n\"I would like Park Ji-Sung to become a symbol of challenge for all Koreans,\" 30-year-old Kim Young Woo, who is a great fan of Park, said.\nKim said he admires Park for never giving up and admits to watching at least 70 percent of all Manchester United games even if it means staying up until three in the morning on weekdays.\n\"I think young people will look at him and tell themselves that they want to take on challenges, too,\" Kim said.\nSomething Park wants to see as well. The midfielder signed on a deal to build a Park Ji-Sung football center in his hometown fully equipped with training areas and football fields. He believes there should be a better future for Korean football.",
        "An interview with the wife of Taysir Alluni, Fatima al-Zahra.\nAljazeera: Was Taysir ever involved in legal problems in Spain or has he ever been previously arrested?\nFatima al-Zahra: No. This has never occurred.\nA: But this was circulated by some in the media.\nFZ: I assure you that Taysir has never been detained before. As for what has been circulated by the media, they have even mentioned that I was a Christian and converted to Islam after we were married and that I named myself Fatima al-Zahra. This is untrue since I originally belong to Muslim parents while my children bear Muslim names.\nA: Have the Spanish security authorities permitted you to contact Taysir?\nFZ: Since his detention and the beginning of investigations he was permitted only once to call me and the children. The next time he was permitted to make a recorded call for only two minutes. This call had only worried me more about his health.\nYou are aware that he suffers from backache besides his heart illness. The strain he felt was apparent in his voice when he talked to me.\nA: How do you respond to the accusations levelled against Taysir? Had he really been close to the Taliban movement during his stay in Afghanistan?\nFZ: Taysir only went to Afghanistan after he joined Aljazeera in 1999 as a correspondent and manager of the channel's office in Kabul. He reflected the suffering of the Afghani people to the world through Aljazeera.\nI would like to state clearly here that Taysir has been a staff member at the Granada Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies since 1996 and up to today. This institute is mainly designated for preparing studies that help bridge the gaps between any conflicting parties in the world as well as preparing studies on Islamic fundamentalist movements.\nHis concern was focused on North African and Arab and Islamic regions since he is a Muslim Arab. He was then assigned by the institute to prepare studies on the Taliban movement in Afghanistan along with what they see as fundamentalism and extremism in order to reach a means for closing the gaps between conflicting parties. What I mean here is the conflict between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance.\nThe institute had also planned to host a delegation from the Taliban to discuss with them ways of reaching a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan.\nBut some media organisations then accused Taysir of collaboration with the Taliban.\nI do not like the accusation that Taysir collaborated with the Taliban or al-Qaida. I am challenging anyone who can give a single piece of evidence to support this accusation. He was deeply sympathetic to the Afghanis for what they have suffered from misery, subjugation and bitter internal conflict.\nTaysir had repeatedly tried to contact some figures from the Northern Alliance but had no response from them. What he sought from his contacts was to convey the scene on the other side through Aljazeera Channel.\nHe also tried to mediate between the conflicting parties in the context of the role he played at the institute. That took place in the year 2000 before the resumption of hostilities and fighting between the two parties, as they usually begin fighting during the summer.\nThe greatest evidence of Aljazeera's impartiality on this matter, with Taysir being the channel's representative in Afghanistan, and an evident refutation of the accusations against Aljazeera of sympathising with the Taliban, was the channel's airing of an interview it had with the leader of the Northern Alliance, Ahmad Shah Masud.\nAljazeera had sent another reporter to conduct the long interview that took nearly two hours after Alluni advised them it was impossible for him to reach the other party despite his repeated attempts.\nA: How did the Granada Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies react to the accusations levelled against your husband?\nFZ: Its attitude was supportive to Taysir. Following the US war against Afghanistan in 2001 some Spanish papers blasted him, accusing him of supporting the Taliban and al-Qaida. The Spanish paper El Pais reported that the Spanish police had been tracking the Spanish journalist working for Aljazeera.\nBut the institute had published an article in which it expressed its views on Alluni saying he was a person of peaceful tendencies and that that tendency had marked all his work and actions.\nThe institute also said that, being an organisation that advocates humanitarian and cultural interaction and rejection of all forms of violence, it had discussed the possibility of designating Taysir as a diplomatic liaison man with the Taliban. The institute believes in dialogue as a means of resolving conflicts.\nAfter the recent accusations, Ahmad Kamil of Aljazeera had a meeting with the director of the peace institute and conveyed his testimony which contained a similar evaluation (of his character and work) as recently aired by Aljazeera.",
        "Pratibha Patil\u2019s Museum: Gifts received by VVIPs from foreign countries can be purchased by them but can they be loaned?\nWhy couldn\u2019t outgoing President Pratibha Patil follow the norms like other VVIPs and buy the gifts she received officially, instead of getting them loaned to her proposed museum?\nGifts which VVIPs including President of India receive during their official foreign tours are the property of the nation and are deposited in the government treasury called the Toshakhana. They can be purchased at market value by the VVIPs, if they so wish. In fact, according to the ministry of external affairs, \u201cthe total amount collected by the government by allowing retention of gifts by VVIPs during past three years and the current year is Rs62,000.\u201d So, why couldn\u2019t outgoing President Pratibha Patil follow the ministry\u2019s norms and buy whichever gifts she received officially instead of having them free of cost?\nThe notification of the ministry of home affairs dated22 June 1978 does not mention anything about giving away such gifts on loans to the respective VVIPs. However, around 155 gift items which Pratibha Patil received during her tenure as President of India have now been \u2018loaned\u2019 to the collector of Amravati, where Ms Patil\u2019s family trust is building a museum to showcase her political journey.\nEarlier VVIPs which include presidents, vice-presidents and ministers, could retain gifts that they receive on foreign trips which are valued at Rs1,000 and that too can take home only one such gift in case they receive more than one on a particular tour. In an amendment made by the ministry of home affairs in 1999, the amount has been increased to Rs5,000 and the VVIP can purchase the gift item as per the market value of the \u201ccountry of origin\u201d over and above that amount. This means that the VVIP can retain any gift he or she receives during official tours abroad free of cost in case the value is Rs5,000 and below. However, if he or she wishes to possess any other gift which is beyond this amount then, he or she will have to pay the market price as valued by the ministry of external affairs.\nIn a written agreement signed between the Presidential Estate and the Collector of Amravati, the 155 gifts out of the 2,500 gifts that Pratibha Patil received in her tenure as the President of India, have been \u2018loaned\u2019 to her trust for a museum under-construction, in her hometown in Amravati, without any time frame for returning them to the Rashtrapati Bhavan\u2019s \u2018Toshakhana\u2019 (treasury).\nMs Patil, who courted controversy and impropriety in terms of grabbing a sprawling 2,42,000 sq ft defence land for her luxurious post-retirement home in Pune (which she abandoned after a series of articles in Moneylife) and for having spent Rs200 crore on her foreign trips with an entourage of family members in practically every trip, is now all set for another bad precedence, where propriety too is being questioned.\nAs per the last notification of the ministry of home affairs dated 27 January 1999, \u201cIn regulation of the foreign contribution (acceptance or retention of gifts or presentation regulation 1978 in sub-regulation (1) the following proviso shall be inserted namely: provided that a minister my retain a gift or presentation made to him/her provided the value of the gift assessed under sub-regulation 5 does not exceed Rs5,000.\u201d There is no mention of loaning out of these gifts to the individual after retirement which are received in the official capacity of the VVIP, on behalf of the entire nation.\nThis writer has invoked the RTI (Right to Information) Act and sent off an application under Section 6 of the RTI Act to the Central Public Information Officer in the President of India\u2019s office on 3rd August. While reply is awaited, I request each one of you who reads this article to independently send a similar RTI query which will ensure citizen pressure, enough to compel the CPIO to reveal the required information from the august office.\nCopy of rules and regulations for \u2018loaning\u2019 official gifts received by President of India to presidents on their retirement or loaned to any other organisation.\nCopies of official requests made specifically by Ms Pratibha Patil to President of India office and correspondence between President of India\u2019s office and ministry of external affairs (MEA) and collector, Amravati, Maharashtra regarding loaning of a number of gift items for a museum in Amravati.\nSimultaneously please scan and email all the certified documents at [email protected].\nThanking you in advance and requesting you to send me the information as early as possible.\nProvided that in case where such person received such gift or presentation while he is visiting any foreign country or territory outside India such intimation may be made by him within 30 days from the date of his return of India.\n2. Every gift or presentation received by such persons for any foreign source shall be deposited by him with the secretary to Government of India in a ministry or the department which has sponsored that delegation of which he was the member within 30 days from the date of intimation by him of such receipt under sub-regulation (2).\n3. The secretary to the Government of India, referred to in sub-regulation 3 shall forward every such gift or presentation deposited with him to the Toshakhana in the ministry of external affairs for assessment of its market value in India.\n4. Such assessment shall be made within 30 days from the date of receipt of the gift or presentation in the Toshakhana in accordance with the rules applicable, for the time being in force to the valuation of articles in the Toshakhana and such persons shall be intimated in writing of such assessment forthwith.\n5. The assessment so made under sub-regulation 5 shall be final and shall not be called in question by such person.\nProvided such person shall have the option that exercised by him within 30 days from the date of receipt by him of the intimation under sub-regulation 5 to purchase such gift or presentation on payment of the difference between the market value in India of such gift or presentation as assessed under sub-regulation 5 and Rs1,000 (now Rs5,000); provided further that the option once exercised under this sub-regulation SHALL be final.\nMadam Pratibha's fame is well known. She had not rendered accounts for the MPLAD she received earlier even though years have elapsed. I think BJP was after her & to make her escape Madam Sonia made her President (well, the first woman president!). It was being said that the amount was donated to a trust which was being run by her husband, Devising Shekawat.(A fine ruse to oppose Opposition Presidential candidate Shekawat. I may be corrected if I am wrong,). She extensively toured the world as President (she led a trade delegation to SA just before demitting office!). We made a big fanfare of her being a woman president even though there are many better, dignified women who could have adorned the post with aplomb. She adorned the homes of Indira & Sonia Gandhi better for which she got the reward. A quote from English describes her -\"SOME ARE BORN GREAT, SOME ACHIEVE GREATNESS, & UPON SOME GREATNESS IS THRUST\" and she belongs to the last.\nIt only shows that person like Pratibha Patil can rise to occupy highest position of President of India, but can't overcome her greediness.\nMadam Deshmukh - One more article which made public the gift articles of VVIP for which country has ownership rights. I do not remember any controversery and/or news after retirement of Dr.Rajendra Prasad/ Dr.Sarvapalli R /Dr.Zakir Hussain/ Dr.Kalam and country still adores them.\nThis is like putting a ladder against the neck of the camel, climbing up and slapping it. he ! he ! he !\nI am 200% sending this RTI on monday and urge all the readers to spend Rs 10 on the IPO and another Rs 20 on stationary and pastage and 20 minutes from their busy schedule to send this RTI.\nMore people need to join the RTI Movement to expose the 'Manmani' of the public servants, enjoying at taxpayers money.\nWhile the RTI (Right to Information) Act in India is being currently used by activists and thousands of citizens who have learnt through self-learning or workshops, the government is seriously discussing with the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to introduce it as a lesson in schools and colleges.\nTen-year old Aishwarya Parashar of Lucknow created history by filing a RTI query regarding the garbage dump outside her school and had a library established in its place. In February this year, she created a flutter by sending a RTI query to the PMO office, asking for the order that gave Gandhiji the status of the \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d. She is a mini-activist with youngsters asking her RTI queries or doubts on her mobile or email, and she quickly responds to them. This shows that if school children are educated, they can become active RTI users and help in monitoring governance or satiating curiosity.\nLast fortnight Nepal, which implemented its RTI Act in 2007, introduced the subject in the mass communication curriculum in its secondary schools. For this, a leading RTI organisation, Freedom Forum, continuously lobbied for educating students on right to information, since the last two years. Finally, the Curriculum Development Centre (CDC) under the ministry of education introduced it.\nIn Maharashtra, the discussion to include a lesson of RTI in the civics subject was talked about fervently in the early 2000s but is yet to see reality. At that time too, discussions were almost bearing fruition. RTI activists had lobbied for the introduction, in order that the citizen-friendly RTI Act is ingrained at that impressionable age and becomes known as everyone\u2019s tool for pro-active participation in our democracy rather than a weapon in just the hands of few.\nMany media colleges in India do touch upon the subject of RTI but not enough to inspire young journalists to use it as a key tool for their stories as they are not familiarized with it, comprehensively. Pioneer of RTI movement, Aruna Roy insists that since 2005 when RTI Act was introduced, journalists can take pride in procuring government documents themselves by using RTI and thus skirting the traditional \u201cofficial source\u201d which may have vested interest and may not provide the whole truth. However, the RTI use in media fraternity is quite low. Hence, it is appreciable that the Symbiosis Institute of Media & Communication (SIMC), Pune, has recently initiated a unique RTI familiarization and uses the programme for students to inculcate the wide use of this tool for investigative and informative journalism.\nA fortnight back, 300 under-graduate and post-graduate students of Symbiosis Institute of Media & Communication, Symbiosis Law College and Symbiosis School of Economics filed RTI applications in subjects of their interest. The issues addressed were varied and the lesson on how to write RTI applications was monitored by noted RTI activist Nikhil Dey, member of MKSS (Mazdoor Kishan Shakti Sangthan) and RTI activist Bhaskar Prabhu, founder of Mahiti Adhikar Manch. Presently, these RTI applications are being classified as per \u2018city\u2019 and \u2018subjects\u2019 after which Pune-related RTI queries would be sent to the respective public authorities by the students.\nThis exercise was conducted at the second, two day seminar of Symbiosis Institute of Media & Communication, Pune. Pioneering RTI crusader Aruna Roy was the chief guest of the seminar and addressed students on the importance of using RTI as a tool for investigative journalism. While SIMC has a chapter on RTI Act in its Media & Civic Affairs subject, since March it has embarked upon a full-fledged practical orientation programme to the subject through a series of workshops and seminars to be held in the academic year. In order to amplify the knowledge and use of RTI, SIMC is preparing a RTI manual for journalists based on the two seminars, which would be available online as well as in print in a book form, for the benefit of students and journalists across the country.\nWith the government attempts to dilute the RTI Act every now and then, RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar believes that enlightening young minds on this law will throw up a whole new generation of RTI-informed citizens, making it difficult for the government to muddle around.\nSo much exercise is being done to educate the people about the usefulness of RTI power, but if the common understanding of having a power to have a SAY in the election and selection of the politicians or candidates are not there, any other ACT will be for only self-aggrandisement to play, \"DIVIDE and RULE\", Comments for and against, Like and Dislike, throughout our troublesome journey of life, where only handful 5% of the 120 crore population will be deformed, corrupted and benefited under the guise of reforming the 104 crore citizens of our country!\nRTI Act is in the public interest, but it is becoming a tool for the vested interests only.\nWe have to plan a strategy which benefits the remaining 95% also without wasting time for any other acts which are going to benefit only 5% of the public!\nWAKE UP! JAAGO DUNIYA, JAAGO! Now or NEVER!\nConsider this: When, The Associated Press, in early 2011, filed Right to Information (RTI) request for information on terrorism charges and convictions in 105 countries, it got its reply from Turkey within a week; India, within a month; Mexico within two months; while the Canadian government sought a 200-day extension to give the reply. According to news reports, only 14 countries responded with the full information within their legal deadline; most countries did not provide any of the information asked for. The FBI too took six months and at the end of it, gave only vague replies.\nHence, it is not surprising that leading countries with otherwise good governance like USA and UK are ranked 39th and 28th in a comprehensive world-wide RTI Rating Project undertaken by Centre for Law and Democracy based in Canada (which stood 52nd) and Spain-based Access Info Europe. The results of the two year study were recently unveiled and showed that India ranked second having scored an impressive 130 out of 150 points with Serbia ranked first with 135 points.\nThe study was \u201ca comprehensive comparative analysis of the legal frameworks for accessing information in each of the 90 countries where such a system exists.\u201d Which means, the focus was only on how strong are the provisions in the RTI laws of the 90 chosen countries and not on how effective is the implementation, as that would be a cumbersome and complicated endeavour. Besides being assessed on 61 main indicators, the rating was given under seven different categories: Right of Access, Scope, Requesting Procedures, Exceptions and Refusals, Appeals, Sanctions and Protections, and Promotional Measures. The total count was 150 points. \u201cThe indicators were drawn from a wide range of international standards on the right to information, as well as comparative study of numerous right to information laws from around the world,\u201d states the http://www.law-democracy.org website.\nThe study was initiated by Toby Mendel, president of Centre of Law and Democracy, Canada. Before founding the Centre for Law and Democracy in January 2010, Toby Mendel was for over 12 years senior director for law at ARTICLE 19, a human rights NGO focusing on freedom of expression and the right to information. He has provided expertise on these rights to a wide range of actors including the World Bank, various UN and other inter-governmental bodies, and numerous governments and NGOs in countries all over the world. Experts who reviewed India\u2019s scoring points were Venkatesh Nayak and Anjali Bhardwaj for India and members of Commonwealth Human Rights Initiatives (CHRI), which works to raise public awareness of RTI amongst people and communities.\nIn the comments, Venkatesh Nayak and Anjali Bharadwaj have made the following observations which give a balanced overview of the RTI Act in India: \u201cIndia has long been recognised as one of the most advanced countries in the world when it comes to access to information, but its failure to top this ranking is demonstrative that global standards of the right to access have advanced considerably since India\u2019s law was first passed. This is not to say that India's legal framework is bad.\n\u201cAs this score indicates, it remains one of the top countries in the world, but there are several problems with India's access regime. Chief among these are the blanket exceptions in Schedule 2 for various security, intelligence, research and economic institutes. Instead of such broad and sweeping exclusions, these interests should be protected by individual and harm-tested exceptions. The Indian legal framework also does not allow access to information held by private entities which perform a public function, and several of the law\u2019s exclusions, including for information received in confidence from a foreign government, cabinet papers and parliamentary privilege, are also problematic\u201d.\nPakistan, which implemented the law in 2002 is ranked 66th. According to an article based on this study in International The News of Pakistan, \u201cPakistan is among the last 20 countries in the Global Right to Information (RTI) rating, ranking 72 out of a total of 90 countries surveyed, with neighbouring India coming in at third place and other countries in the region, such as Nepal and Bangladesh, also doing exponentially better than Pakistan. Even Mexico, otherwise considered very hostile to journalists, has been ranked seventh while Ethiopia, another country described unsafe for journalists, has earned the tenth position. Yemen too boasts of more liberal access to information than Pakistan, ranking 20th on the index.\nScores of some important countries are: Germany-54; Russia- 60; Japan-67; China-72; Canada-79; Australia-84; USA-89; and UK-97.\nFor those complaining about the power of the RTI Act in India, this would not only be an eye-opener but should inspire us to use it effectively and in large numbers.",
        "H.O.P.E. aims to create a community for students who have gone through adverse childhood experiences.\nA new student group that started at the University of Minnesota last month hopes to provide support and teach coping mechanisms to students affected by traumatic events during childhood.\nResearch on adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, only began in the 1970s. ACEs are experiences of \u201cabuse, neglect, exposure to domestic violence and neighborhood violence, peer victimization, and parental mental illness,\u201d according to Karatekin\u2019s website. Many researchers define ACEs differently, but in many cases they are defined as moderately to severely stressful experiences that occur during childhood up to the age of 18, Karatekin said.\n\u201cWe saw a need for college students to have a supportive environment where we understand these experiences ... because it does affect their mental health well-being [and] their physical health well-being.\u201d said Emame Thompson-Eja, a University second-year psychology student and a research assistant in the Child Wellbeing Research Group, a project led by Karatekin.\nThompson-Eja said meetings and events sanctioned by H.O.P.E. \u2014 which stands for healing, overcoming, persisting and encouraging \u2014 will focus on teaching ways for its members to overcome adversity, build resilience and self-efficacy and offer social support for members struggling with ACEs.\nACEs can be correlated with unemployment, underachievement, incarceration, substance abuse and can even be linked to physical ailments such as asthma and cardiovascular disease, Karatekin said.\n\u201c[ACEs] affect the whole body as well as mental health,\u201d she added.\nMorgan Bilz is a first-year University student who said the promise of leaving home to attend college was what pulled her through some of her most trying days. During her childhood, Bilz said she and her four siblings experienced divorce and familial mental health crises and were victims of mental and emotional abuse.\nBilz said these experiences still impact her today and they have motivated her to study child psychology.\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the person that I am today, but I hope to be there for the kids that felt the way that I did at the time,\u201d she said.\nAt the University, Bilz said she\u2019s found her calling and place in spite of her early traumatic experiences.\n\u201cI\u2019m a freshman and I\u2019ve found my place and found out exactly what I want to do ... and organizations that are very tailored to my passion. I\u2019ve literally never been happier,\u201d Bilz said.\nAvery Yang, a 26-year-old student studying psychology, said he realized he was dealing with ACEs only one year ago. Yang said he had a particularly difficult childhood as a first-generation college student who experienced widespread abuse, familial mental illness and domestic violence.\nYang said he felt the presence of ACEs in his life has hindered his college experience and even made him question what he gained from his studies at the University. When H.O.P.E. was founded, it provided him the community he said he had desperately needed earlier in his college years.",
        "Multimillionaire Republican Bruce Rauner proclaimed victory and \u201ca new direction\u201d as Illinois\u2019 next governor Tuesday night, even as Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn refused to concede defeat.\nBut a defiant Quinn declared, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in throwing in the towel\u201d with votes uncounted.\nIt was a fitting end to an Election Night that capped an often-vicious contest that saw unprecedented amounts of money spent and much vitriol thrown around.\nSpeaking just minutes after Quinn, Rauner made no mention of the governor\u2019s defiance. Instead he focused on voters choosing a \u201cdivided government\u201d \u2014 a Republican in the governor\u2019s mansion and both Illinois houses controlled by Democrats.\n\u201cI am honored, I am humbled to go to work for you and every family in this great state,\u201d Rauner told a robust crowd packed into the ballroom at the Hilton Towers.\nRauner added that he had called Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan and Illinois Senate President John Cullerton.\nRauner did not mention whether he had attempted to call Quinn.\nWith 99 percent of the precincts tallied, Rauner took 51 percent of the total vote, while Quinn had 46 percent.\nThe results came after polls showed the two locked in a dead heat for weeks.\nRauner, a newcomer to the political scene, had pumped $27 million of his own personal fortune into the race. A year ago \u2014 before he had even won the Republican primary \u2014 Rauner began running ads with his focus on attacking Quinn.\nDemocrats did what they could to drive voter turnout, including making sure various questions appeared on the ballot, including a non-binding referendum that asked whether the state\u2019s minimum wage should be raised to $10 an hour.\nBefore Rauner declared victory, the Associated Press, NBC News and other news agencies projected him the winner.\nQuinn spokeswoman Brooke Anderson insisted that \u201cthousands, if not hundreds of thousands,\u201d of ballots hadn\u2019t been counted yet.\nIt\u2019s true that numerous precincts were still not counted due in part to Election Day snafus in different parts of the state. However, analysts were pointing to Rauner\u2019s lead as seemingly too large a margin for Quinn to overcome.\nRauner\u2019s team was showing confidence as late returns arrived.\nA new law allowing same-day voter registration caused issues in Lake County, leading to polls remaining open until 9 p.m. rather than 7 p.m.\nMost pronounced, however, were issues in Chicago, where Democratic votes are the richest. Officials with the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners estimated that thousands of election judges did not show up after they received false information through bogus robo-calls. As a result, six precincts remained open later and vote counts out of the city were delayed.\nStill, turnout appeared healthy elsewhere in the state, and Republicans pointed to Rauner\u2019s numbers running higher than state Sen. Bill Brady did in 2010 against Quinn. Rauner also was on track to take 20 percent to 21 percent of the city vote. In 2010, Brady lost against Quinn by just 32,000 votes.\nAnderson was similarly optimistic early in the evening.\nAnderson took comfort in the some 800,000 people who cast their ballots early in Illinois.\nThe campaigns had already broken spending records \u2014 at about $100 million collectively \u2014 with $65 million of that from Rauner\u2019s campaign.\nThe bulk of Quinn\u2019s and Rauner\u2019s campaign spending went toward a steady stream of negative political ads that aired on a seemingly endless loop.\nRauner\u2019s candidacy to \u201cshake up Springfield\u201d seemed to gain traction throughout the state. However, Rauner\u2019s rhetoric early on that he would take on \u201cgovernment union bosses\u201d rattled union members, who have been among the most influential of groups working to get people to the polls. Quinn also benefitted from large-scale union financial contributions.\nRon Gidwitz, a Republican co-chair on Bruce Rauner\u2019s campaign, said he had confidence in the party\u2019s field operation.",
        "\"We Are the World\" was such an obvious choice for record of the year in Tuesday night's 28th annual Grammy Awards ceremony that it seemed almost anti-climatic when the envelope was actually opened.\nStill, it was a supreme moment in pop history when co-writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie stepped on stage to a standing ovation to accept the Grammy on behalf of USA for Africa, the organization that sponsored the benefit recording project.\nQuincy Jones, who produced the record and joined Jackson and Richie at the podium, thanked \"the generation that changed 'I, Me, My' to 'We, You, Us.' \"\nIn accepting a Grammy earlier in the evening for best song, Jackson said, \"First, I'd like to thank God.\" After pausing briefly, he added, \"I'd like to thank (Him) for picking Lionel and myself to write 'We Are the World.\"\n\"We Are the World,\" which also won in two additional categories, suffered its only loss in the album competition to Phil Collins' \"No Jacket Required.\" This wasn't a surprise because the \"We Are the World\" album--which included tracks donated by various artists--was a far less distinguished work than the single.\nThe best-record victory made \"We Are the World\" the first charity-oriented recording to win in a top Grammy category since the \"Concert for Bangladesh\" was named best LP in 1973.\nAnd \"We Are the World\" represented a far more dramatic chapter in rock history than the earlier effort.\nIt was almost 13 months to the day that Jackson and Richie were joined in a Hollywood studio--about a dozen miles from the Shrine--by an unprecedented lineup of pop and rock stars to record the song that triggered worldwide concern for famine victims in Africa.\nBut so much has happened since that dramatic night at A&M; Studios that it seemed as if years had passed. The irony of the \"We Are the World\" success is that the single was virtually ignored in a year-end poll of the nation's 200 leading pop and rock critics.\nMaybe the record seemed to be too simple and sweet a gesture for writers who prefer more biting and sophisticated commentary. But part of pop and rock's most valuable asset has been its ability to inspire.\nAs much as any event in pop cultural history, \"We Are the World\" brought together, even if for a few magic moments, the normally fragmented pop audience in a way that almost seemed impossible in this cynical age.\nWhile Jackson and Richie stood on stage with Jones and other emmbers of the USA for Africa musical team, their song played once more over the sound system.\nIt was a touching reminder of just how far a single song can take us.\nAfter \"We Are the World,\" the closest thing to a major sweep was provided by Phil Collins--who was honored for best album, male pop vocal and (with Hugh Padgham) best pop producer.\nOther key winners included Sade (new artist); Whitney Houston (female pop vocal); Tina Turner, Don Henley and Dire Straits (rock vocals); Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and the Commodores (R&B; vocals); Cleo Laine (female jazz vocal); Wynton Marsalis (solo and jazz instrumentals); Rosanne Cash, Ronnie Milsap and the Judds (country vocals).\nManhattan Transfer's \"Vocalese\" album figured in three awards. Jon Hendricks and Bobby McFerrin won best male jazz vocal performance honors for their contributions to \"Another Night in Tunisia,\" a track from \"Vocalese.\" The Transfer itself was cited for best jazz vocal by a group, while Cheryl Bentyne and McFerrin were named best vocal arrangers for their work on \"Tunisia.\"\nJan Hammer picked up two Grammys (pop instrumental performance and composition) for his \"Miami Vice Theme,\" while the Winans' \"Tomorrow\" album also registered two Grammy wins. Marvin Winans was judged best male soul gospel singer, while the Winans won best soul gospel group vocal.\n\"Beverly Hills Cop\" was judged best sound-track album, while \"West Side Story\" was declared top cast show LP.\nChicago Symphony Orchestra conductor Sir Georg Solti, who already held a record 23 Grammys, won another by being honored in the best opera recording category.\nIn addition, Broadway composer Andrew Lloyd Webber won his first classical Grammy for best contemporary composition and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, with Robert Shaw conducting, captured four awards, the most by any classical group.\nThe \"We Are the World\" single, which featured such singers as Ray Charles, Bob Dylan and Diana Ross, both shaped and defined the Pop-as-Benefactor syndrome that was a dominant theme of pop music in 1985.\nWhile project catalysts Harry Belafonte and Ken Kragen (manager of Lionel Richie and Kenny Rogers), were inspired by London-based rocker Bob Geldof's actions in organizing a 1984 British charity recording called \"Do They Know It's Christmas,\" the \"World\" single and album stirred the pop imagination and conscience even more dramatically.\nIndeed, it was the success of \"We Are the World\"--which raised more than $40 million for famine relief--that enabled Geldof to mobilize the forces required to put on the landmark Live Aid concerts in London and Philadelphia last summer.\nThe spirit of \"We Are the World\" and Live Aid was also picked up by a variety of other groups, including the April 9 \"Cantare, Cantaras\" recording, which was aimed at raising funds for health and nutrition concerns in South and Central American countries, and last fall's Farm Aid concert, which focused attention on financially-troubled U.S. farmers.\nThe session that produced \"We Are the World\" included some of the most honored performers in all of pop--all told, they have received more than 110 Grammys in past ceremonies.\nSixteen belonged to Quincy Jones--the second-highest number of awards by a non-classical artist. The award Tuesday as producer of the single left Jones only three shy of pop front-runner Henry Mancini.\nOne of the common complaints against the Grammys over the years is that the voters recognize commercial, \"safe\" acts and ignore rock's challenging new forces. Among those who were woefully under-acknowledged: Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Phil Spector, the Who, David Bowie, Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Randy Newman and Neil Young.\nBut the 6,000 members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences have a way of making up for the oversights--the lifetime achievement awards. The Grammy voters may have missed honoring the Rolling Stones in the years when that English band's music really mattered, but the academy passed out the lifetime achievement award to the Stones on Tuesday.\nEric Clapton presented the award in London in a ceremony shown live on the U.S. telecast via satellite. Clarinetist-bandleader Benny Goodman and classical guitarist Andre Segovia were also honored with lifetime achievement awards. Past recipients include Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, and Elvis Presley.\nIn addition, George and Ira Gershwin were honored Tuesday with a Trustees award. Barbra Streisand made the presentation to Mrs. Ira Gershwin.\nKenny Rogers hosted the ceremony.",
        "For decades, immigration hard-liners have felt sidelined and taken for granted by Republican presidential candidates, left with dog whistles and policy crumbs. But Donald Trump's ascent to the top of the Republican ticket has changed their fortunes.\nLongtime advocates for shutting the door to new immigrants now hold crucial positions in Trump's campaign, and many feel, for the first time in recent memory, they have a candidate who is willing to speak plainly about reducing immigration flows and offers their clearest shot yet at influencing, perhaps even drastically altering, U.S. immigration policy.\nJoe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff and poster child for workplace raids and traffic stops, earned a prized seat on Trump's airplane a few months ago, spending hours with his new close friend. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the fiercest opponent of GOP-backed \"amnesty\" bills in Congress for the last decade, now smiles and demurs when asked whether he might serve as Trump's running mate or settle for a Cabinet position.\nAnd NumbersUSA, long on the fringes of Washington lobbying groups with its stance that legal immigration should be reduced, now crows that all those powerful consultants had it wrong when they insisted that the GOP needed to compromise on raising immigration levels to win a presidential election.\n\"Trump broke all the rules \u2026 got hammered for it, and just kept going,\" said Rosemary Jenks, vice president and director of government relations for NumbersUSA.\nTrump's upending of the Republican establishment has sapped clout from many who are used to having it, and empowered others who had grown accustomed to the margins. Nowhere is that reordering more pronounced than the immigration debate, in which Trump's rise has exposed a widening gap between the party's elites -- and stalwart allies such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- and its voters.\nTrump's ascent vindicates those who argue that working-class voters see immigration as a threat to financial security. But the political argument has only been proved in Republican primaries, meaning Trump's allies in the immigration policy community could lose their influence if he is defeated in the general election, in which a large Latino turnout favoring Hillary Clinton could doom the GOP candidate.\nFor now, allies such as Arpaio, the Maricopa County sheriff whose controversial immigration enforcement tactics prompted an investigation from President Obama's Justice Department, are relishing the moment. Arpaio said he received a note from Trump three years ago because of their mutual interest in questioning Obama's birthplace -- an unfounded conspiracy theory -- but did not meet the candidate in person until a year ago, when he introduced Trump at a campaign rally in Phoenix. Recently, Arpaio's ailing wife received an uplifting six-minute phone call from Trump.\nArpaio said he has endorsed Republicans in prior presidential elections, but never with the same fervor.\n\"He doesn't need to go through my wife to hook me,\" Arpaio said. \"He had me hooked to begin with.\"\nSessions may have the deepest ties to Trump among anyone in Congress. In January, one of his top aides, Stephen Miller, became Trump's senior policy advisor.\nMiller, 30, with thinning hair that lends an air of gravitas, has not only become influential in Trump's campaign, he has unexpectedly emerged as one of Trump's most fiery warm-up acts, earning him a cult following among Trump's ardent backers.\n\"Everybody who stands against Donald Trump are the people who've been running this country into the ground,\" Miller said during a recent Dallas rally, waving his hand from behind a lectern. \"They're the people who've been controlling the levers of power. They're the people who are responsible for our open border, for our shrinking middle class, for our terrible trade deals. Everything that is wrong with this country today, the people opposing Donald J. Trump are responsible for.\"\nMiller, who did not respond to a request for comment, would likely assume a key role in a Trump administration. The firebrand has helped position Trump as the furthest right on the issue within a primary field that was already hard-line. During a rally in April, he called Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the most conservative members of Congress, an \"Obama ally\" who backs a \"radical policy of mass migration.\"\nThough many Republicans in Congress have held out against efforts to bring legal status to millions of immigrants who entered the country illegally, the party's presidential nominees have been willing to compromise. Miller grew up in Santa Monica in the shadow of President Reagan's 1986 immigration overhaul, which tightened border security while granting amnesty to nearly 3 million immigrants who had already crossed illegally.\nThe last Republican to hold the Oval Office, George W. Bush, tried but failed to pass an overhaul that would have granted a path to legal status for 12 million such immigrants. His chief Senate ally on the issue, Arizona Republican John McCain, won the party's presidential nomination in 2008 before renouncing his own bill. Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee, called for \"self-deportation,\" in part to assuage conservatives who were concerned about his prior support for Bush's overhaul.\n\"President Bush pushed for an amnesty bill at that time that the American people rejected,\" Sessions said. \"Trump's on the other side.\"\nTrump inspires supporters' angst and anger over trade, but at what cost?\n\"I don't think anybody has articulated [as] effectively the impact that this lawlessness is having on wages and security of people,\" Sessions added.\nSessions was among Bush's chief antagonists in Congress, and fought the issue again in 2013, when Republican leaders pushed their party to craft another overhaul with Obama. The plan, which died in the House after Senate approval, was prescribed in a postmortem that followed Romney's 2012 loss, amid concerns from party leaders that the GOP could no longer compete in national elections unless it changed its tone and passed an overhaul that would remove immigration as a political wedge issue.\n\"I totally reject that,\" Sessions said. \"What people care [about] \u2014 they want economic growth, they want wages to go up.\"\nSessions said he backs Trump on almost every aspect of his immigration rhetoric, though he talks more about the nuts and bolts of crafting policy, working \"your way through achieving the goals in a practical manner.\"\nSessions' allies at NumbersUSA are only slightly less trusting in Trump, noting that on some issues they care about, such as curbing the guest-worker program, he has made inconsistent statements. They also view Trump's persistent call for a border wall as a \"symbolic catchphrase\" that is less important to enforcement than electronic verification for workers and systems that track entry and exit.\nJenks and Chris Chmielenski, director of content and activism for NumbersUSA, said they have not had direct contact with the Trump campaign. Yet the influence of Sessions and Miller gives them a confidence they have never had in a presidential candidate.\n\"The biggest problem with the immigration issue is people don't know how to talk about it,\" said Jenks.\nNor does NumbersUSA support mass deportations, which Trump has said he would instigate.\nYet many Republicans remain concerned that Trump's appeal to white working-class voters will not sustain the party in national elections. Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford), whose Central Valley district is 71% Latino, said last week that he won't support Trump, joining some Republican lawmakers in South Florida who represent districts with large Latino populations.\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican who has worked with Democrats for years on an immigration overhaul, has said he will back Trump, but has not been enthusiastic. In an interview, he blamed Obama and his use of executive authority to halt some deportations for creating resentment among Republicans that empowered \"some fringe-element voices to almost sound like they are a majority\" in the GOP.\nRomney won only an estimated 27% of the Latino vote, and polls suggest that Trump is faring worse, behind Clinton 62% to 23% among Latinos in one recent Fox News poll. Many analysts have said Trump would need votes from 40% of Latinos to win the election.\nImmigration advocates point to California's Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot initiative intended to crack down on illegal immigration. Voters approved the measure, backed by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, and the party has not recovered from voter backlash in the state.\n\"What happened in California many years ago is what is happening in the country now,\" said Ben Monterroso, executive director of Mi Familia Vota, a Latino advocacy group.",
        "In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Cold War tensions and threat of nuclear war convinced government leaders in the United States that millions of lives could be saved by the construction of home fallout shelters.\nThe idea took a while to take hold. Even though public drills in the event of a nuclear attack was routine in the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration did not actively promote the construction of home fallout shelters. That changed with the 1957 publication of the Gaither Report, which backed the building of shelters that \"permit people to come out of the shelters and survive.\"\nThe change came after John Kennedy became president. Against the backdrop of escalating tensions with the Soviet Union, Kennedy urged Americans to build bomb shelters in a speech he delivered on Oct. 6, 1961. \"We owe that kind of insurance to our families and to our country. ... The time to start is now. In the coming months, I hope to let every citizen know what steps he can take without delay to protect his family in case of attack. I know you would not want to do less.\"\nKennedy also pressed Congress to allocate more than $100 million to build a network of public fallout shelters. Congress responded by voting for $169 million to mark and stock fallout shelters in public and private buildings. In short order, the media picked up the message. For instnace, January 12, 1962 cover story of Life magazine was given over to a story about \"The Drive for Mass Shelters\" with the tease, \"New Facts You Must Know About Fallout.\"\n\"New from plywood research! Two effective family fallout shelters, well within the means and ability of the average homeowner to build. Fully approved by the Dept. of Defense. Both call for simple, economical construction with big panels of waterproof plywood combined with concrete block (Basement Shelter) or sand or gravel fill (Above-Ground Shelter.) Strong, safe, dependable, durable. Sent 25c and coupon below for booklet with plans and information:\"\nAs the `60s gave way to the `70s and the fear of nuclear war receded in the age of detente, fallout shelters soon went the way of the hula hoop, relegated to the status of a cultural relic.

        "Barnes Regional Airport Manager Brian Barnes addresses residents Monday about changes in noise levels around the airport.\nWESTFIELD - Changes in flight operations at Barnes Regional Airport, both military and private aircraft, have resulted in changes in the noise impact levels on homes in and around the airport.\nThat is what residents living near the airport were told at a workshop Wednesday night at North Middle School.\nThose changes have resulted in a reduction of about 50 percent the number of homes that will now qualify for noise mitigation proposals offered by the Federal Aviation Administration.\nAirport Manager Brian Barnes told the nearly 200 residents Monday that changes at the airport involve flight patterns, upgrades and improvements to runways at Barnes and newer and less noisy engines on corporate aircraft. Also, Barnes said there has been a significant \"cut back in the number\" of F-15 Eagle fighter jet operations by the Air National Guard's 104th Fighter Group that calls the airport home.\nOverall, Barnes said the airport saw 120,000 operations annually in the 1990s but now only handles about 42,000 flight operations annually.\n\"What has happened here is nothing new,\" Barnes said. \"It happened at Westover Air Reserve Base and Burlington, Vt.. Those bases also experienced similar decreases in flight operations over the years.\"\nThe noise mitigation program at Barnes Regional Airport is being directed by Wyle Laboratories of Arlington, Va.\nThe mitigation project started here in 2010 with 364 residential homes are the airport identified as eligible for mitigation, either through acquisition or upgrade. Eligible were 52 homes for outright acquisition by the FAA and another 312 homes targeted for noise mitigation ranging from sound proofing to extensive renovation.\nSince 2010 Wyle has completed the purchase and demolition of 10 homes and noise mitigation to 84 homes.\n\"That would leave about 240 homes in the original program but changes in the noise impact now only identifies about 124 homes for the project,\" Barnes said.\nPatricia Madamas has lived directly in the main flight path of Barnes Airport since 1979 at 340 Holyoke Road.\n\"I am here because I am curious to see how things have changes,\" Madamas said. \"My home was evaluated in the first study and I am now waiting for them to purchase my home. I turned down noise mitigation and I planned on a spring acquiisition.\n\"Recently I was notified that will be delayed but I expect them to still honor the acquisition,\" she said.\nThe airport manager told residents that the FAA will dictate the scope of the noise mitigation project and data now being collected by Wyle through the new noise study and resident input from Monday night and ongoing comments from the public will be presented to the FAA for review.\n\"We are still soliciting comments and people are urged to submit comments or contact us to discuss issues,\" Barnes said.\nJane W. Verbeck, Wyle project managered assigned to Barnes Regional Airport, was busy Monday night handing out mitigation applications to several residents.\nThe noise map associated with Barnes Airport must be updated every four years, officials said.",
        "As I said the other day, being an environmentalist in China is not easy and potentially bad for your health.

My father got hit in the head by six or seven people, with their fists. He is now feeling dizzy and sleeping all the time,\u201d she added, claiming the attack had been orchestrated by local officials.\nCalls to the mobile phone of the local Communist Party chief went unanswered on Wednesday.\nWe\u2019re heading that way fast\u2026 only with more guns.\nI foresee life as a meme for the bizarre \u201c[You] used the internet, you always use the internet!\u201d said by the mob.\nChina\u2019s path to prosperity and national independence has been betrayed at every juncture by the CCP, a rancid collection of Stalinist\u2019s and Maoist\u2019s with a choke hold on government.

        "A few weeks ago, the parents of a former Central Michigan University student with a severe peanut allergy spoke out about an incident that allegedly took place in the fall.\nThe student had a near-fatal reaction after another student allegedly smeared peanut butter on his face at an off-campus location.\nFormer student allegedly hazed by \"underground fraternity\"\nThe attorney for a former Central Michigan University student filed a complaint with the Mount Pleasant Police Department alleging he was hazed by an unaffiliated fraternity in October 2016.\nThis incident highlights the need for more awareness of food allergies on college campuses.\nLast fall, a study was presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Conference, which found that most colleges do not have plans in place to support students with life-threatening food allergies outside the dining hall.\nIn other words, coaches, professors and peers don\u2019t have the information they need to help safeguard students against exposure to allergens.\nAs a faculty member and the parent of a child with food allergies, I know information and education is needed.\nSince my son is only five years old, I carry his EpiPen, read all of his food labels before he eats anything, plan ahead for social events involving food and communicate with his teachers. But college is a time of transition when young people become responsible for managing their allergies without mom and dad.\nThat puts the burden on young adults with food allergies to communicate with other students, staff and faculty. Teenagers and young adults with food allergies are at the highest risk for life-threatening reactions.\nWhat do you need to know about food allergies?\nEight different types of food account for the majority of food reactions: peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat, soy, fish and shellfish. The number of Americans with food allergies is on the rise. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2013, food allergies among children increased approximately 50 percent between 1997 and 2011.\nThe Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America reports that 1 in 13 children has food allergies, and 1 in 50 Americans is at risk for anaphylaxis \u2014 a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. Every three minutes, a food-based allergic reaction sends someone to the hospital, and more than 300,000 children under the age 18 are sent to emergency rooms each year for food allergies.\nIn another sobering statistic, Food Allergy Research and Education, reports that one-third of children with food allergies report being bullied because of their medical condition and allergies.\nEven if you are not affected by food allergies, you likely know someone who is. You may meet people when you host or attend social events, wait tables at restaurants, coach youth sports or go into the teaching profession. Even a small amount of cross-contamination can be life-threatening for people with food allergies.\nLet us use this incident to raise awareness here at CMU and take steps to keep each other safe.",
        "The seriousness of this scandal cannot be overstated, for what we are witnessing is the systematic betrayal, not only of successive generations of children, but also of universities and employers who can now have little faith in the credibility of their qualifications.\nFrom exam boards to the watchdogs who are meant to guard standards, the modern taxpayer-funded education system has been exposed as rotten to the core.\nIt pains me to say, as a former Ofsted inspector, that the whole thrust of this episode reveals how deeply the cancer of anti-intellectualism has spread through our schools. The very institutions which should be spreading knowledge, encouraging creative thinking and promoting essential skills, have been caught in an exercise of cynical, commercially-driven deceit. Their behaviour is the very opposite of the purpose of education.\nThis crisis over exams has come about entirely because of politics and people in the sector acting for commercial gain. During Labour\u2019s 13 years of rule, there was insidious collusion between the exam boards and government to mislead the public into thinking that standards were on the rise.\nLabour politicians could trumpet ever higher grades as evidence of the success of their spectacular increases in spending. Meanwhile, the exam boards also had a vested interest in this mass deception; the more pupils passed, the happier the schools would be and the more schools would choose to use those exam boards. In turn, this would increase the boards\u2019 profit and turnover. So a huge commercial racket came into being driven by greed.\nEffectively the boards have been running a lucrative cartel, with the aim of raising productivity rather than knowledge and understanding. Though the examiners and markers themselves are often badly paid, those at the top have reaped huge rewards for this strategy. One Edexcel chief was on an astonishing \u00a3327,000 a year, while salaries of \u00a3200,000 are common, an excess all too typical of the self-serving quango class of bosses that New Labour created.\nThe tragedy is that those who should have blown the whistle on this racket have instead connived in it. The qualifications watchdog Ofqual knew about the courses in which exam boards told teachers how to boost exam grades, which are publicly advertised, but did nothing. What has been grievously lacking at Ofqual is both a sense of leadership and an understanding of education.\nThe current head, Glenys Stacey, is a public sector bureaucrat who follows the great British tradition of people being appointed into top jobs in areas about which they know little. Nor, up until now, have Ofsted or schools distinguished themselves by their determination to root out abuses.\nTragically for our young people, this squalid saga is part of a wider pattern of decline in British schooling. Such a failure has come about not because of any lack of resources \u2013 the excuse always favoured by the teaching unions, local education authorities and left-wing campaigners.\nIndeed, as a nation, we have been spending more than ever before on state schools, as reflected in the significant rise in teachers\u2019 salaries and in the construction of shiny new buildings across the country.But the increase in expenditure over the past 15 years has been accompanied by a remorseless drop in standards. Subjects have been dumbed-down, as grade-inflation has soared.\nThis process of dumbing-down can be seen all around us. The idea of intellectual inquiry has been replaced by a destructive obsession with ticking boxes and reaching arbitrary targets.\nExams are undoubtedly less demanding than they were in the past. Research by the University of Durham in 2008 found that A-levels overall are two grades easier than they were in 1988 and in mathematics modern A-levels are 3.5 grades easier. Shamefully, work worth an E grade 20 years ago is now worth an A.\nSo far have standards sunk in the state sector, in some cases, a scholarship entrance paper for a public school at the age of 14 can be harder than an A-level paper.\nThe deliberate campaign to drive down exam standards explains one of the fundamental paradoxes of our society: that pass rates have never been higher, yet employers and universities have never complained more bitterly about the low calibre of supposedly well-qualified students. In fact, universities now have to run remedial classes in the basics of English and maths for those who have failed to attain the proper standard, despite having A-level qualifications.\nSimilarly, last week it was reported that supermarkets have to send new recruits to special numeracy and literacy classes, even though these ex-pupils had passed their GCSEs.\nIt was Mike Tomlinson, the former head of Ofsted, who admitted that a modern maths GCSE is no genuine indicator of an essential mastery of numeracy - which makes you wonder what the exam is for. In the same vein, the battery of vocational qualifications has been severely compromised. It has long been an absurdity that a single National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) can count as four GCSEs, when it is barely worth one.\nWhat we need now is wholesale reform. At least the current Coalition, unlike the last Labour government, has demonstrated a genuine willingness to clean out the stables.\nIn Education Secretary, Michael Gove, and the new Head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Willshaw, the Government has exactly the right people for the task but, as this scandal illustrates, it is going to be a huge job.",
        "Muralitharan\u2019s feat, apart from being a BIG moment for cricket, is also testimony to the thrill and supremacy that only Tests command.\nSo much for the death of Test cricket. Muttiah Muralitharan, one of the game\u2019s modern titans, played his final remarkable hand yesterday, taking Sri Lanka towards victory over India. At Headingley, meanwhile, Australia battled to stay in a tight contest against Pakistan, having been bowled out for 88 in their first innings on Wednesday. Imran Khan, the great Pakistan all-rounder, was the latest to foresee Test cricket's demise this week, warning that the financial lure of Twenty20 will lead to more and more players choosing to avoid the five-day game.\nPaying glowing tributes to Muttiah Muralitharan, who had just retired from Test cricket, former India captain Sourav Ganguly today said he would rate the Sri Lankan a tougher spinner to face than his long-time competitor Australian Shane Warne.\nIndia may have flopped in the opening cricket Test against Sri Lanka but opener Virender Sehwag held on to the number one spot, while Sachin Tendulkar gained a place to be seventh in the latest ICC rankings for batsmen issued today.\nSteven Smith's scored a maiden half-century as his late assault on the Pakistan bowling helped Australia set a competitive target of 180 for Pakistan to win the second test at Headingley on Friday.\nDelhi registered their second consecutive win with a 2-0 victory of Uttar Pradesh to inch closer to pre-quarterfinals of the 64th National Football Championship for Santosh Trophy at Khardah Stadium here today. Delhi now lead Cluster V with six points from two matches and require a draw against Madhya Pradesh on July 25 to seal a last 16 berth.\nThe five-member inquiry panel appointed by Hockey India to probe into the sexual misconduct allegation levelled against women's hockey team chief coach Maharaj Kishan Kaushik by woman player Ch. Ranjitha Devi, today submitted its report, which is learnt to be a \"factual account\" of the episode after the panel examined the written submission of both the parties and their oral statements.\nEven Rs 400 crore has not proved enough for the authorities to import underwater electronic equipments for the Shayma Prasad Mukherjee (SPM) swimming complex, which will hold swimming events during the Commonwealth Games (CWG).\nJust five days ahead of the Hockey India\u2019s (HI) scheduled elections at New Delhi, the Hockey Chandigarh today knocked the doors of Punjab and Haryana High Court to get affiliation from the government-backed body.\nBeijing Olympics quarter-finalist Jitender Kumar and former women's world champion Lekha KC are among the three pugilists recommended by the Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) for this year's Arjuna awards. N Usha is the third boxer recommended by the IBF for the awards, which would be given away on August 29 - the National Sports Day.\nGrandmaster Parimarjan Negi finally broke his point duck with a morale-boosting draw with leader Wesley So of Philippines in the fourth round of the Young Grandmasters tournament, a part of the 43rd Biel chess festival here.\nSo much for the death of Test cricket. Muttiah Muralitharan, one of the game\u2019s modern titans, played his final remarkable hand yesterday, taking Sri Lanka towards victory over India. At Headingley, meanwhile, Australia battled to stay in a tight contest against Pakistan, having been bowled out for 88 in their first innings on Wednesday.\nImran Khan, the great Pakistan all-rounder, was the latest to foresee Test cricket's demise this week, warning that the financial lure of Twenty20 will lead to more and more players choosing to avoid the five-day game.\nThere has never been a Twenty20 game, though, that could offer the sort of drama that Murali created with his last-ever ball in Test cricket, when he induced an edge from the Indian tail-ender Pragyan Ojha which was taken expertly by Mahela Jayawardene at slip. Murali has rarely been off centre stage during a career that has embraced glory and controversy but this was a special way to go even by his standards.\n\u201cI don't want to get into comparison but I would prefer Warne. Murali is more accurate and has more variations so tougher to face,\u201d Ganguly said. Ganguly termed Muralitharan's Test retirement after his final five-day game against India at Galle as end of an era.\n\u201cWarne, Kumble had already retired and now Muralitharan... It is an end of an era,\u201d Ganguly said. \u201cMurali's record will be very hard to beat, he has been a great chapter in Sri Lankan cricket, having reigned supreme for more than 15 years. He is hard to be compared with anybody,\u201d he added.\nSehwag, who scored 109 and 31 in the Test which India lost by 10 wickets, has opened up a 14-point gap over second-placed Kumar Sangakkara. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's iconic off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, who spent a record 214 Tests and 1,711 days in the number-one spot, retired from Test cricket at the third spot in the bowling chart.\nThe 38-year-old, who finished with 800 wickets from 133 Tests, bowed out in third position behind Dale Steyn of South Africa and Pakistan's Mohammad Asif after climbing two spots in the latest rankings following figures of 5-63 and 3-128 which set-up a 10-wicket victory for Sri Lanka in the first Test of the three-match series in Galle.\nThe bowlers dropping in the latest rankings include off-colour Indian pacer Ishant Sharma, who was down one spot to 22nd, Rangana Herath (31st, down six places) and Pragyan Ojha (58th, down by nine places).\nSteven Smith's scored a maiden half-century as his late assault on the Pakistan bowling helped Australia set a competitive target of 180 for Pakistan to win the second test at Headingley on Friday. Australia were bowled out for 349 on the stroke of tea on the third day as number eight batter Smith butchered 77 in 100 balls.\nHe began slowly but eventually smashed nine fours and two sixes, including two in succession off leg-spinner Danish Kaneria with the latter finding the roof of the rugby ground stand. Smith was the last man out, bowled by Umar Gul. Australia lost key wickets throughout the day in pleasant batting conditions but managed to eke out enough runs to set up what is likely to be a nervous chase for Pakistan, who have not beaten Australia in a test for 15 years and must win to draw this two-match series.\nAustralia's battling effort, after they were dismissed for a 26-year low 88 in the first innings, has given genuine hope of an eighth straight test win. Mohammad Aamer, the 18-year-old left-arm pace bowler, claimed all three wickets of the morning session and he finished with four for 86 as Australia's last five wickets raised 185 valuable runs.\nBowling: Aamer 27-6-86-4, Asif 26-4-83-2, Gul 15.3-1-80-1, Amin 6-1-12-1, Kaneria 21-2-74-2.\nIn another match of the same cluster, Madhya Pradesh defeated Arunachal Pradesh 3-1 at Howrah Stadium to score their first win. In a Cluster VI match, Chhattisgarh rode on a Wasim Raza strike in the 31st minute to beat Sikkim at Mohun Bagan ground here.\nBoth Delhi and UP had wins against their respective opponents in their first matches and they began on a watchful note and the first half remained goalless. Tuishim Mashangva gave Delhi the lead in the 60th minute while Bhuvan Joshi converted a penalty in the 78th minute to shatter UP's hopes.\nThe Hockey India panel, headed by Rajiv Mehta, and comprising Ajit Pal Singh, Zafar Iqbal, Dr Sudarshan Pathak and Anupam Gulati, has not apparently made any inference from their inquiry, but given only a factual account of what had transpired in front of them. Rajiv Mehta said the inquiry panel based its report from the testimonies of the coach and the player/players, and not on any other evidence.\n\u201cWe had lots of testimonies from both the parties, some players and manager Madhu Yadav, and we didn't need any other evidence before concluding our report\u201d, Rajiv Mehta added. Hockey India will submit the report to the Sports Authority of India (SAI) tomorrow for further action, as coach Kaushik and video grapher Basvaraj were engaged by it.\nHockey India secretary-general Narinder Batra said in the afternoon that the body had received the panel report \u201cwhich we will study and discuss thoroughly before submitting the report to SAI\u201d. But it was unlikely that Hockey India too may come to any definite conclusions based on the report.\nM.K.Kaushik resigned as chief coach following the sexual harassment charges against him, professing his innocence, and Hockey India president Vidya Stokes had accepted it.\nThe videographer was sacked earlier when evidence surfaced about his compromising positions with prostitutes during the team's tour of Canda and China. Hockey India wants to get rid of the controversy without tying itsef in knotts ahead of the Hockey India elections on July 28, and it's playing its card clerverly, neither overtly supporting the coach, nor fully negating the stance of the girls.\nThe officially inaugurated SPM swimming complex is all set to hold test events for the games from July 27 without underwater electronic machinery called \u201ctouch pad\u201d. The Organising Committee (OC) has not been able to import the equipment so far. The stadium has been renovated at the whooping cost of Rs 400 crore and was inaugurated on 18 July.\nThe equipment, which is fitted under the swimming pool, records the exact time of the reach of each swimmer and displays it on the board. \u201cThe results of the test events will be based on manual observation which would undoubtedly include errors,\u201d he said. The absence of the equipment will deny Indian swimmers the advantage of knowing the exact status of their performance during tests.\nWith only 72 days left, the CWG stadiums are getting inaugurated every second day. But what has left everybody wondering is the quality of the work delivered in the hustle-bustle of the run-up for the games. The authorities undertaking the completion of the CWG venues are now just smartening up things on the surface.\nThe members also said the stadium would further require atleast more than one month to get complete. \u201cThere is no way that can complete the stadium before a month or two,\u201d said sources. Not only this, the changing rooms in the complex have been reduced to half in both size and numbers.\nHowever, the Secretary of the Association, Raj Kumar, said the OC has managed to get the equipments from Pune on temporary basis but they are yet to be installed. \u201cThe touch pads used in the Youth Commonwealth Events in Pune have been brought here for the trial events but they are yet to be installed,\u201d said Raj Kumar. The sources said it required around eight days to install and test the equipment but given only four, it is nowhere possible that it would be installed. He also confirmed that the main machinery to be used during the games had been not yet imported. The stadium was built before the \u201982 Asiad.\nThe local body, which was earlier named as the Chandigarh Hockey Association (affiliated with the Indian Hockey Federation), filed the case through its president Chander Shekhar, IPS and senior vice-president of the Indian Hockey Federation and Secretary General Yash Pal Vohra. Notably, the HI approved the affiliation of Hockey Chandigarh along with 11 other states without any issue during its November 30, 2009 meeting.\nThe HI also called on two representatives (one male and one female) from the HC to attend their first annual general meeting scheduled for February 7, 2010. But later in the end of May, the local body was disaffiliated, asking them to send their application through the Chandigarh Olympic Association.\nBut somehow the body could not get the required recommendation. Later the name of Chandigarh body was not found mentioned in the electoral college of the body. Along with the government, the Indian Olympic Association also backs the Hockey India. Seven other state units, including Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Mumbai, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan have also filed the cases to attend the July 28 elections.\nWhile Lekha clinched the middle weight gold in the 2006 edition of the World Championship held here, Usha has been a two-time silver medallist in the same event. \u201cAll three of them have performed well in the past three years and we thought they are the best contenders from boxing for the Arjuna Award,\u201d Indian Boxing Federation Director AS Dagar said.\nBoth Lekha and Usha had been recommended last year as well but Jitender 's name has been nominated for the first time. \u201cIt is a huge honour for me to be recommended for this award. I hope I get it,\u201d said Jitender, a two-time Asian Championship bronze medallist, who created quite a flutter at the 2008 Beijing Olympics by fighting his quarterfinal bout with 10 stitches on his chin.\nThe 22-year-old Harayana boxer was also a bronze medallist in the 2008 World Cup held just a few months after the Olympics. He was recently signed up by the World Series of Boxing's Indian Franchise Videocon for the professional-style tourney starting November 19.",
        "EAGLE: Augusta National for having the guts and wherewithal to hold the final round in the morning. The Masters is the one sporting event that can dictate to TV, instead of the other way around, and it worked out great.

But it would have been nice if at least one of them had put real pressure on him down the stretch. Where was Bob May when he was needed?\nBIRDIE: And you thought Tiger waited a long time, with 14 years between green jackets. Caddie Joe LaCava had a Masters-winning loop for the first time in 27 years (Fred Couples, 1992).\nBOGEY: Francesco Molinari had an epic collapse, following his water ball on No. 12 with a hacker-like chunk into the drink on No. 15. But he does get points for having said ahead of time that his win over Woods at the British Open last year would have no bearing. Plus, he was the only golfer in the field noticeably disappointed about not winning.\nACE: Before Bryson DeChambeau fell apart on Friday, he had an entertaining news conference as co-leader Thursday. He admitted that he never had made a hole-in-one. On Sunday morning, he got one, on No. 16 (as did Justin Thomas).\nBIRDIE: The course was wet, soft and fairly slow. And still it didn\u2019t yield ridiculously low scores. Woods won at 13-under.\nBOGEY: The par-5s at Augusta National, especially the ones on the back nine, are basically automatic birdies.

Masters chairman Fred Ridley said there are ways to toughen holes such as No. 13 without simply adding length. Now\u2019s the time to explore.\nBIRDIE: Jack Nicklaus still is ultra-relevant. He videotaped his arrival, reminiscing on 60 years since his first Masters. He wrote a love letter to the course and tournament.

        "UPDATE: Lancaster County District Attorney, Craig Stedman says Thursday was one of the darkest days in Lancaster County. He says the family knew the suspect and called him, \"Pie.\"\nStedman says Thomas was arrested in April and charged with sexual assault against one of the victims and another girl. He was presumed innocent but Stedman says his previous sexual assault charges could have led him to the stabbings.\nPolice say canines used the scent of blood from in the victims' home to track the suspect's scent at his nearby home.\nDA Stedman says this case is a \"hallmark for the death penalty.\"\nUPDATE: We now know the name of the man accused of killing a woman and her teenage daughter Thursday morning in Lancaster County.\nEAST DRUMORE TOWNSHIP, Pa. -- Police say Leeton Thomas stabbed Lisa Scheetz and her 16 year old daughter to death inside of a home in East Drumore Township along the 800 Block of Spring Valley Road.\nPolice found them dead in the basement.\nEMS took Scheetz' other teenage daughter to the hospital, she is listed in stable condition.\nShe is initially called police around 2:30 in the morning.\nPolice arrested Thomas at his home in Quarryville, Lancaster County on Thursday.\nHe is now facing criminal homicide charges.\nPennsylvania state police will be holding a press conference at eight o'clock Friday morning.\nFOX43 will have a crew there and will bring you the latest details on this story.\nA suspect was taken into custody Thursday for a series of stabbings at a home that resulted in the deaths of a 44-year-old woman and her 16-year-old daughter and left a 15-year-old daughter critically injured.\nPolice received a call from the 15-year-old around 2:20 a.m. Thursday, saying she had been attacked in a home on the 800 block of Spring Valley Road.\n\"It's a tragic event,\" Tpr.

        "This post originally appeared on Dealnews.\nSometimes, your family and friends put gifts on their wish list that, as a savvy shopper, you know won't offer them the best value possible.\nFor example, while many people will request an iTunes gift card during the holidays, you'll learn that an Amazon card could actually provide the recipient with far more music in the long run.\nSo instead of springing for, say, the new iPad mini, what should you buy in its place?\nBelow are our top 10 items you shouldn't buy this holiday season, and 10 alternatives to consider instead.\nThey want an iPad mini? Give them an iPad 2 instead.\nDespite being a more recent release, the new iPad mini packs the same 1024x768 display that's found in the iPad 2.\nIn fact, everything about the iPad mini, from its screen resolution to its performance, is comparable to the iPad 2; the only difference is that it's smaller.\nAnd yet, at $329 for the 16GB model, the iPad mini costs $10 more than a refurbished iPad 2 16GB WiFi Tablet.\nWe thus recommend opting for the latter, which comes in immaculate condition from Apple with the same 1-year warranty, as well as more screen real estate for media streaming, all for $10 less than the mini.\nThey want a NOOK HD? Give them a Kindle Fire HD instead.\nMake no mistake, the NOOK HD is a perfectly capable tablet with very similar performance and features to its rival, the Kindle Fire HD.\nHowever, when it comes to the ecosystem of each, Amazon has the upper hand.\nThe store has more consistently offered aggressive pricing on media like eBooks and MP3s, it has a more robust app marketplace, and Fire owners can stream Prime-related film and TV whenever they want.\nMoreover, Barnes & Noble is experiencing a slowdown in its core business of book-selling, which financially affects the NOOK and its supporting services; meanwhile, Amazon is enjoying record-breaking sales of its Kindle devices.\nAs a result, Amazon's Kindle Fire environment will continue to flourish and will likely remain stronger than that of the Barnes & Noble NOOK.\nThey want an iPhone 5? Give them an iPhone 4 or 4S instead.\nWhile it's now possible to find deals on a refurb iPhone 5, when it comes to saving money, the iPhone 4 and 4S are still your best options.\nLike the iPhone 5, both models can run iOS 6, however, the 4S now retails for $100 less.\nWe've even seen deals that drop to as low as $1 (with a 2-year contract).\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 4 is always available for free with a contract, and both previous generations see more deals than the iPhone 5 does.\nThey want a handheld game console? Give them an iPod touch instead.\nBecause of the smartphone, there are numerous small devices that now seem unnecessary, like the handheld game console.\nSure, there will always be Nintendo 3DS and Playstation Vita fans, but a device like the WiFi-enabled iPod touch now satisfies the desires of most casual gamers with its endless library of games, which now includes popular console franchises like EA's FIFA 13 Soccer, Assassin's Creed, and Call of Duty.\nPrice-wise, these apps are considerably cheaper and are more readily discounted than games for the Nintendo 3DS or Playstation Vita, so your giftee can save money in the future when buying new titles.\nThey want a Starbucks Gift Card? Give them a Keurig K-Cup Machine instead.\nInstead of giving a coffee aficionado the traditional Starbucks gift card, we recommend picking up a Keurig K-Cup machine, because it could potentially save them money in the long run.\nThe Keurig B130 In-Room K-Cup Brewing System specifically has dropped to as low as $50 multiple times this year, most recently on Thanksgiving Day.\nSince we consistently see deals on 24-packs of K-Cups, this purchase will not only save your giftee from the shackles of Starbucks, but over time it'll save them a substantial amount of money versus daily visits to a local coffee shop.\nThey want a 3D HDTV? Give them a standard HDTV instead.\nAlthough it has been years since its mainstream debut, 3D HDTVs are still much more expensive than traditional LCD or plasma HDTVs.\nPlus, as far as content goes, the recipient will still need to purchase a 3D Blu-ray player (along with expensive 3D Blu-ray discs) to watch their favorite movies in 3D.\nMaking matters worse, last year we noticed a 10% price increase on 3D HDTVs during the month of December.\nAs a result, we recommend going with a 1080p LCD or plasma HDTV instead, many of which hit our price predictions last month.\nThey want clothing? Give them a gift card to their favorite apparel store instead.\nBuying clothes for another person can be difficult; not only must you decipher your recipient's style, but you have to guess the right size as well.\nThis year, we say skip the needless anxiety and give them a gift card instead.\nThis allows them to buy the apparel they want at the right size.\nFurthermore, it spares them from the annoying ritual of having to exchange/return an unwanted gift, an act which many times goes unfulfilled as your gift collects dust in their closet.\nThey want a digital SLR? Give them a mirrorless digital camera instead.\nThe mirrorless digital camera offers much of the same versatility and improved image quality that you get from a DSLR, but with a generally less complicated interface, more compact size, and smaller price tag.\nFor example, the pictured Olympus PEN E-PL2 and Zuiko Digital 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 II Lens bundle is a bargain at $299 (with free shipping, a low by $25).\nMoreover, unless your recipient is a well-documented photography enthusiast, he or she is more likely to use a mirrorless camera, as opposed to a bulky DSLR, because it's easier to carry around.\nThey want a Roku media player? Give them a Blu-ray disc player with streaming instead.\nDon't get us wrong; several staff members at dealnews enjoy the Roku player.\nBut whereas the Roku provides only streaming, a WiFi-enabled Blu-ray player can also, you know, play Blu-ray movies.\nYour giftee will thus be able to take advantage of two types of deals as they roll in: physical Blu-ray titles and discounted movie rentals.\nThat's ideal, considering it's an excellent time to be buying Blu-ray movies, with titles as low as $5 a pop; that's about what it would cost you to normally rent an HD movie.\nOnly in this scenario, you get to keep the movie, and you have the proper device to watch it.\nThey want an iTunes Gift Card? Give them an Amazon Gift Card instead.\nAside from the obvious fact that an Amazon gift card can be used for a wider selection of items, let's focus on the value of the cards for music.\niTunes rarely discounts its music and media. When it does, the discounts aren't prominently advertised, so good luck finding them.\nAmazon on the other hand pushes regular sales on MP3 albums, sometimes undercutting iTunes by as much as $8.\nKnowing this, an Amazon gift card will gift the recipient a greater number of songs.",
        "About three weeks ago, my sister popped an intervention on me. \"Your clothes say 'cool',\" she explained with an inhale, \"but your hair says 'sister wife'.\"\nIt was time, I learned, for the absolute loathsome task of going to get a haircut.\nI'm just one of those laid-back people who doesn't really care too much about my hair. It grows fast, I know that much, and it's curly, unless I straighten it. It's in a top-knot if it's not down. It's usually unwashed (because it's healthier and it saves time) and it doesn't get greasy unless I accidentally scratch an itch with a fork covered in gravy, which has happened exactly never. OK, once. Fine! Twice. God. What's with you and the third degree?\nHaircuts aren't a necessity because I never really have a style, it's just, you know, on my head and makes me avoid looking bald. A win if ever there was one.\nSo it's not that the cutting of the hairs is traumatic or anything. I don't even mind paying stupid NYC prices for a new \"'do\", either. My problem, people, the reason I hate getting my haircut, friends, is because of the mirrors.\nIn what world is it considered a luxury, or a nice way to treat yourself, by sitting in front of a floor to ceiling mirror for 45 minutes in a backwards cape? It's hell.\nFirst you sit down with your kind of gross hair, because yeah, you haven't even bothered to try and make it look nice since you knew you were getting your hair done this week. You didn't even try, and it shows. And now you're sitting there (and by the way, no one looks good sitting in front of a mirror) with a stylist folding and poking your dirty mane as you try to avoid direct eye contact with ... yourself.\nAfter the hair washing, which is never really unpleasant, you come back to the awful haircutting seat to see that yesterday's makeup has started running down your face, and that GOOD GOD, wet hair is not your best look. In fact, this is probably the worst you've looked in months.\nAnd that's just the beginning. You have to sit there, in that horrible salon lighting, and play the \"Am I looking in the mirror too much? Too little? Am I too vain? Am I too scared? Do I look in the mirror more or less than the person next to me? OH GOD AM I DOING MY MIRROR FACE?!\" game for the better part of an hour.\nThe blow-drying provides somewhat of a barrier between you and your reflection, but then, then, they go ahead and double it.\nThe stylist forces you to hold a hand mirror and spins you around in front of the gigantic mirror in a sadistic dance that will only stop once you've thoroughly convinced them you like what you see.\nI don't know about you, but they could've shaved my head like a deranged Britney Spears and I still wouldn't have been able to tell them fast enough how much I like it, just to make the mirror spinning stop.

        "The Dolphins need to give Kilgore another a year because, frankly, they have nobody else. But an NFL official who spoke to the Dolphins said Miami is taking a wait-and-see approach with Kilgore, as far as whether he\u2019s good enough to be here beyond 2019.\nAt 31, Kilgore is actually two years older than Pouncey. In terms of sticking on the roster, it helps that he\u2019s a cheap, serviceable starter.\nKilgore has two years left on his contract, with a $2.2 million base salary in 2019 and a $3.0 million salary in 2020.\nPro Football Focus gave Kilgore a 52.9 grade for his four games last season, which would have ranked 31st of 38 centers if Kilgore had enough snaps to qualify. PFF gave Pouncey a 56.9 grade, which was 25th.\nFor all the concerns about Pouncey\u2019s health, he has now played in all 16 games two consecutive seasons. And the Dolphins didn\u2019t urgently need the cap room when they released him.\nKilgore said his injury was healed enough for him to have played in December if needed. But he couldn\u2019t, because the Dolphins had placed him on injured reserve.\nDolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick (14) says he is in peak off season form after a three-day voluntary minicamp at Baptist Health Training Facility at Nova Southeastern University on Tuesday, April 16, 2019.\nKilgore is fortunate in that unlike Miami\u2019s other lineman who was injured - Josh Sitton - he wasn\u2019t released. But Sitton was more expensive than Kilgore. Sitton recently retired after Miami cut him.\n\u25aa Dolphins defensive tackle Davon Godchaux, who\u2019s 6-3 and 315 pounds, revealed the team has him working at nose tackle when Miami plays a 3-4 defense. But the Dolphins would like to add a natural 3-4 nose tackle in the draft process and recently brought Wisconsin\u2019s 346-pound Olive Sagapola to team headquarters.\nThe Dolphins\u2019 biggest defensive linemen are 325-pound Durval Queiroz Neto (a Brazilian player who will be an 11th player on Miami\u2019s practice squad this season) and 323-pound Joey Mbu (a journeyman and former Alliance of American Football player).\nEvery AFC East team has been allocated one player as part of the expansion of the International Player Pathway program. They are ineligible to play in 2019.\nMiami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores says he's living the dream as he speaks to the media before the start of a three-day voluntary minicamp at Baptist Health Training Facility at Nova Southeastern University on Tuesday, April 16, 2019.\n\u25aa The Dolphins have taken a liking to Southern Cal 6-1 cornerback Iman Marshall, a projected mid-round pick who also can play safety. He\u2019s had private contact with Miami recently, a league source confirmed.\n\u25aa We\u2019ve broken and/or confirmed 21 of the Dolphins\u2019 maximum permitted 30 pre-draft visits \u2013 which are never announced by the team - and two others have been reported elsewhere that haven\u2019t been confirmed: Stanford receiver Trenton Irwin and Oregon defensive end/linebacker Jalen Jelks.\nJelks, who\u2019s 6-5 and 256 pounds, moved from defensive end to linebacker in 2018 and his sack numbers fell from 7.0 to 3.5.\n\u201cYou thought would go maybe a little higher when the season began but to me he didn\u2019t produce the kind of year expected, ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper said. \u201cYou look at numbers and when you\u2019re 6-5-and-a-half and you have the length he does, to me there\u2019s an opportunity there to be a disruptor off the edge.\n\u25aa The Dolphins last week called Wisconsin\u2019s Micah Kapoi, who\u2019s appealing to them because he can play every position on the offensive line. At 6-4 and 310 pounds, he played 48 games at Wisconsin, with starts at left guard and right guard.\n\u25aa We hear Wyoming\u2019s Niko Evans is among the running backs on Miami\u2019s radar. He emerged as a prospect last year, averaging 6.5 per carry and rushing for 1325 yards, which was second in the Mountain West Conference.\nHere\u2019s my other Dolphins post from Tuesday\u2019s first practice under Flores, with notes on Xavien Howard, Laremy Tunsil, injuries and more.\nHe thinks \u2018best football\u2019 still ahead of him. So how long will FitzMagic last?\nA look at who some of the draft analysts would take if they were picking at No. 13 in the first round of the NFL Draft for the Miami Dolphins, including detailed analysis from NFL Network\u2019s Charles Davis and expert Tony Pauline.\nThis star recruit is improving.

        "The Port of Oakland is scheduled to approve a new contract with its workers at today's board meeting, but the port \u2014 the total workforce of which is divided between the agency's own public employees, and the employees of numerous corporate contractors who run the maritime and airport operations \u2014 remains unsettled with serious labor disputes. One union is saying its workers could strike before December is over.\nAt Oakland International Airport, workers represented by Unite HERE Local 2850 are now threatening to walk off the job because of an impasse in contract negotiations with a major contractor. The workers are resisting drastic takeaways demanded by their employer, HMS Host. About two hundred unionized HMS Host employees run most of the food service operations at the airport. They work in the central warehouse delivering supplies to dozens of vendors like Starbucks, and they work in the kitchens of several of the larger restaurants like Chili's. Most of these employees make $12 to $14 an hour.\nAccording to Matt Clark, an organizer with Unite HERE, HMS Host is demanding that workers now shoulder the cost of increases in their healthcare insurance. Healthcare costs rose rapidly in the 2000s. Last year alone average premiums paid under private sector plans rose 3 to 4 percent, a significant rise even though it represented a slow down from previous years, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's annual study of health insurance coverage.\nFurthermore, HMS Host is seeking to take back paid lunch-time, which would amount to a 7 percent pay cut for workers, and also is demanding a three- to four-year contract that includes no cost of living increases over its duration, said Clark. \u201cWe have called on Host to agree to a fair contract, but all they\u2019ve offered so far are takeaways,\" said Marcia Voge, a bartender at the airport's Pyramid restaurant. \"Now we\u2019re preparing to do whatever it takes in our fight to win a fair contract.\u201d Unite HERE's members have given HMS Host until midnight tonight to make a different offer.\nHMS Host points to a drop in passenger traffic through the Oakland Airport as the main reason for its austere proposals to the union. The company has a point. In 2007, at the height of the housing and banking bubbles, the airport saw more than 7.3 million passengers. But in 2011, the last year for which statistics are available, the airport saw only 4.7 million passengers.\nPassenger traffic through Oakland doesn't tell the whole story with respect to HMS Host's financial condition, however. The company actually is one of the largest food and retail services contractors in US airports, and many of its operations are in venues that have seen increases in passenger traffic and revenues since 2010.\nHMS Host is owned by the Autogrill Group, an Italian multi-national corporation that is controlled by the Benetton family's four billionaire scions, Luciano, Guiliana, Gilberto, and Carlo. The Benetton's control an amazing proportion of Italy's wealth, including Atlantia, the corporation that owns and operates much of the country's privatized toll highways.\nIn a recent letter to investors, Gilberto Benetton, who lead's the family's Autogrill holdings, said that profits derived from HMS Host are up. \"Travel Retail recorded excellent performance in terms of both sales and, even more so, margins,\" explained Mr. Benetton. \"The airport channel [HMS Host] posted positive results in Food & Beverage as well, where revenues grew faster than the trend in traffic.\"\nIf Wikipedia is any indicator, public sentiment is apparently trending against HMS Host. The company's current Wiki entry includes unfriendly edits, likely from disgruntled staff, that call it \"low-scale,\" and claim that employees are 230 percent more likely to commit suicide or die from heart disease due to HMS Host's unfair working conditions.",

All proceeds go towards legal costs for the Family of Fong Lee.\nAs an artist and community member, I was asked to be a part of the organizing committee for this benefit concert for Fong Lee's family. And it made me consider how violence has always been a part of my life. I was three months old when the Communists shelled the airport all night to hinder our escape from Vietnam. My family came to Phillips in South Minneapolis, where we encountered different types of violence. There were war vets who blamed us for the war, who would yell at us and threaten us in parking lots, on the street, who screamed that they fought for our people and that we owed them. There were gangbangers and crack dealers \u2013 every neighborhood in the world has bullies, and they were ours, mercurial, lively with friendship and smack talk one second and livid with menace the next. There were straight up racists who hated us for the color of our skin, who believed it was our fault that there were no jobs and no homes, or maybe they just hated anyone who didn't look like them, eat like them, talk like them. And then there was the police, whom I was taught to wave at as a child when they drove by, their cars slow in the tight streets, stand up straight, smile.\nAs I got older, I stopped waving to police cars and firemen. No, I never rolled with a crew, but in the 90s during my very early teen years I did rock the Raiders clothes and caps, mostly because that's what we did back then, and partly, I admit, because I wanted to be feared. I never went looking to beat up anyone, bully anyone. But too often, as a young man I found myself fighting or fleeing from all manners of people who wanted to do me harm for all different reasons. You tire of it. Some young men join gangs, some take up martial arts and boxing. Me, I tried to perfect my swagger, practiced my stoic look, blew my paycheck from my minimum wage job on overpriced sports gear, walked like I belonged. And if something did happen to me or my family or friends, we hesitated to call the police, because too often they threatened us rather than served and protected us. Threatened us with violence, with false accusations, with deportation. For us, if we were victimized by violence from a civilian, calling the police felt like an invitation for round two. And they'd walk away to do it another day. By most standards I was an easy child who didn't get into much trouble despite the circumstances. And still I feared the police \u2013 because they had an almost mythical power, especially if you were a person of color, to make you feel guilty even if you weren't doing anything wrong. Chris Rock once joked, \"police officers scared me so bad, they made me think I stole my own car.\"\nWhen I heard that joke, I laughed hard, because I knew exactly what he was talking about. Years before Chris Rock's joke, I was repeatedly pulled over for no reason whatsoever, and on several occasions asked by police officers if I had stolen the car I was driving though they had no reason to ask me this other than my race. Once, I was in a van full of Asian American college students coming back from a student conference and, confused by some construction and the haphazard traffic signs, made a minor driving mistake. A police officer, who made the exact same mistake as we did, swung his car around, stopped us, and verbally berated my friend who was driving, asking in a derogatory fashion if she spoke English. Of course her family had been in America for generations and English was the only language she knew.\nAt this point, those of you who are not people of color may say, that's not fair. It's more about our own psychological issues, and anyway, it's not about race, it's about the law. And maybe it's not fair. Maybe it's not fair that I, as a young man of color from an economically poor urban environment, have an instinctual fear of police officers, some of whom are no doubt good people underpaid to do a very dangerous job, and whom honestly want to serve the community and should not be stereotyped because of a few bad apples. Honestly, it's not fair.\nLet me tell you something else that is definitely not fair, and which is rarely ever considered: the oppressive fear of violence that every person of color faces, every day, in this country, and the proven record of failure of the criminal justice system to treat us and our families fairly.\nWe all have our fears. Some of these fears are consciously and subconsciously taught to us by society, some of them may be reinforced by personal experience. And these fears are absolutely impacted by race, gender, class, sexual orientation. Those of us who are people of color, women, from poor and GLBTT communities have the added fear that if we are victimized by violence, we will be harmed more than helped by law enforcement and the criminal justice system.\nTake the case of Michael Cho, a 25 year-old artist who was shot 10 times and killed by two La Habra police who claimed he was unresponsive to their demands and was threatening them with a tire iron. However, Michael Cho was physically disabled and found it difficult to walk quickly, let alone threaten two police officers.\nOr Marlo and Romel Custodio, who were shot with tasers and beaten by 8 San Jose police officers for allegedly possessing less than half an once of marijuana, and who were cooperating with their arrest. They managed to call their 50 year-old mother, Marilou Alvarado Custodio, who was violently restrained when she arrived on the scene, her head repeatedly banged into a squad car's door.\nAnd \"The Quincy 4,\" young Asian American activists who were brutalized by Boston police as they returned from an engagement party. They were talking to a state trooper in the parking lot of a supermarket when a police squad car rolled up and without warning they were pepper-sprayed and attacked. One of the victims, a young woman named Karen Chen who is just above 5 feet tall, was tackled and beaten by three male police officers, giving her a black eye and numerous bruises. Not only were the police officers unpunished, they filed false charges of resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, of which a Boston judge found them guilty and sent one of these young people, who had done no wrong, to prison.\nUnfortunately, we don't have to look far for incidents involving police brutality. Two Native Americans were stuffed into the trunk of a police car in my old neighborhood, Phillips. Tycel Nelson was a 17-year old African American boy shot in the back and killed by a Minneapolis police officer in North Minneapolis who was offered the Medal of Valor for his killing. He claimed that Tycel had a gun, though evidence seems to contradict this claim. This was in 1990.\nOn July 22, 2006, a 19 year-old Hmong American, Fong Lee, was shot 8 times and killed by Minneapolis Police Officer Jason Andersen, who received the Medal of Valor for his actions. Andersen's partner, Craig Benz, claimed that they were following Lee and his friends because he suspected they were dealing drugs, though no drugs were found on Fong Lee's body. The squad car struck the bicycle that Fong Lee was on and he ran away, and Andersen claims Lee had a gun. However, a nationally recognized video forensics expert analyst stated that there was no gun in Fong Lee's hand in the video from the schoolyard where Lee was shot. Officer Andersen shot Fong Lee in the back and then as he fell to the ground, for a total of 8 times. Police forensic scientists found no blood or DNA on the gun found on the scene that was allegedly Lee's, which is perplexing if we are to believe that this gun was held by a young man who was shot 8 times. There was also some suspicious inconsistencies regarding the paperwork and the history of this gun, which was reported as belonging to the Minneapolis police at the time of the incident \u2013 amongst community members and the family, it is believed that gun was in fact planted by Fong Lee's body in order to justify the killing of the young man.\nThe surviving members of Fong Lee's family recently brought the case to court. The all-white jury of 8 men and 4 women found Officer Andersen not guilty of using excessive force in the shooting and killing of Fong Lee.\n\"We think that it was originally biased from the beginning starting with the judge [Paul Magnuson] and how he handled the case,\" states Shoua Lee, Fong Lee's sister. \"The police could not give solid answers regarding contradictory information about the gun, and so many mistakes were made in the handling of paperwork.\"\nCommunity members point out accusations about Fong Lee's history and character, specifically allegations that he was in a gang, were allowed in court and written about in the press. But Officer Andersen's alleged dislike of Asians and history of derogatory remarks against Asians was neither allowed in court nor written about in the press. \"There were some things mentioned in the media about my brother's past, but then why not write about the officer's past also?\" asks Lee.\nI'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about the ins-and-outs of the law. But what I do know about is who we are taught to fear. I do know that the criminal justice system does not work in the best interest of people of color, and despite the promise that we are treated equally by laws that are colorblind, we are looked upon as guilty until proven innocent. You don't have to be a lawyer to realize that, due to institutionalized racism and the perceived threat that people of color pose to society, it would not be difficult to convince an all-white jury of men and women that an officer of the law was justified in using deadly force against a young man of color in baggy clothes.\nThose of us who are from communities of color understand this far too well. \"Every time something went wrong in the neighborhood, they came looking for kids of color and would drill us with questions,\" remarks Rodrigo Sanchez-Chavarria, a local activist, artist, husband and father of two, and who will be performing at the benefit concert on Saturday. \"My wife was pulled over by police officers for no reason and accused of prostitution.\"\n\"I always think it's interesting when people - primarily Caucasians - talk about feeling safe and secure around the police,\" states May Lee-Yang, a local writer and community worker. \"I've always been taught to be wary, to put on a good front, to avoid any confrontations.\"\nAsian Americans often have to fight against the idea that we have no right to complain, that we should be thankful that we're even allowed in this country and that we would have it even worse back where we came from. \"The tragedy is that when we get here, it's like we exchanged one form of oppression for another, from poverty to prejudice to violence,\" remarks Dr. Michelle Myers, a Philadelphia-based educator, activist, and member of the Asian American spoken word duo Yellow Rage, who will be traveling from Philadelphia and donating her performance to the cause on Saturday. \"Our people still suffer, and the injustice is that we're told to 'shut up and deal' because we supposedly have it so good and because the perception is that we are perpetual foreigners who can never be fully American.\"\nwhere it curves and cuts across 26th. There was no one around, so I did a rolling stop through a four-way stop sign. Yes, I broke the law. I was stopped by a police officer, who asked me to step out of the car and, as he frisked me, asked me if I had stolen the car, and if I had been drinking (I hadn't done either of those things). He flashed his lights in my eyes and asked me to do the nose-touching test, which I did. It was so cold that I was shivering in my coat and I could see my breath as a jagged white fog spurting from my mouth as I answered his questions and did what he asked me. I wasn't wearing gloves, and instinctively, without thinking, I shoved my hands into my coat to warm up. Immediately the cop snapped his hand down to his gun and told me to get my hands out of my pockets, which I did immediately, and he told me to keep my hands up. He said that I could have a gun in my pocket, though he had just checked me a second ago, and when I tried to apologize and explain calmly that it was just cold out and that I had no gloves, he interrupted me and told me to be quiet.\nI got a ticket, and was let go, and I was lucky. I wonder, if that police officer was just a little more nervous that night, or he had a slightly worse day or if he had been just a bit more scared and on edge from working too many hours, or I had been just a bit more unlucky, or if I had tried to alleviate the tension by making a joke which he took the wrong way, or if some tiny interaction between us had been different, and he had pulled that gun, and he had fired shot after shot into my body, and killed me on that street so close to my house in the dead cold empty Minneapolis winter night, how that misunderstanding would be presented to the world. What would have been said. What I would have been accused of. If a jury would have seen me, a young Asian American honors student on full scholarship to a private college who came from a poor neighborhood, as sufficiently threatening. How my family would cope with the injustice, and the utter horrendousness and unfairness of it all.\nFong Lee was a young Hmong American man. He was someone's son, someone's brother. He could have been me, or any one of us, who are unfortunately all too familiar with the devastation of violence, racism, police brutality, and systematic injustice that rips apart our families and our communities.",

        "Channing Frye has had a stellar NBA career. On the day of his last ever NBA game, we look back at his imprint on the Cleveland Cavaliers franchise.\nRooting for the Cavs to lose and tank this season is tough. WFNY\u2019s Josh Poloha explains.\nWFNY\u2019s Andrew Schnitkey talks about the recent success of the Cleveland Cavaliers and what it could mean for the rest of the season and beyond.\nAfter All-Star Break Outlook: What\u2019s next for the Cavs?\nThe second half of the NBA Season starts tonight \u2026 What\u2019s the outlook for the 2019 Cavs over the next 24 games?\nAfter participating in and receiving plenty of praise during All-Star Weekend as a Rising Star, Cedi Osman now has his eyes set on becoming an All-Star.\nThe Cavs acquired a handful of draft assets and helped their tanking efforts this season prior to Thursday\u2019s trade deadline, which seems like a win-win situation for the wine and gold.\nAt just 10-41, the Cavs have been quite a disappointment this season. With that said, it\u2019s better to focus on the good things. WFNY\u2019s Josh Poloha takes a look at a number of the positive aspects of the Cavs, especially in 2019.\nJust in case anyone hadn\u2019t noticed, the Cleveland Cavaliers aren\u2019t very good and there\u2019s no clear path out of this mess.\nGiven his salary, size, and ability to score as a lengthy wing, Rodney Hood could be one of the most attractive trade targets prior to the NBA Trade Deadline on February 7.\nHe may be playing for a small, mid-major school but Murray State\u2019s Ja Morant should be getting just as much attention as any 2019 NBA Draft prospect not named Zion Williamson.\nIt\u2019s been 934 days since that special night on June 19, 2016 and the Cavs *still* live in the heads of the Golden State Warriors. This time, they\u2019re crying about what Cleveland did with Patrick McCaw.\nWith LeBron James, you know anything is possible.\nYou might think you want an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle, but you\u2019d shoot your eye out, kid. So, here is what you should be hoping to see under the Cleveland sports Christmas tree.\nWhen the February 8 deal went down, it was largely painted as addition by subtraction. The Cavaliers\u2019 locker room was toxic, and Ty Lue had entirely too many mouths\u2014and egos\u2014to feed. WFNY looks back at Koby Altman\u2019s mid-season Hail Mary.\nKevin Love surprised many by signing a contract extension to stay in Cleveland even after LeBron James left for Los Angeles. For the Cavaliers, it was a rare positive moment in a sea of turmoil ever since.\nDelly\u2019s return is as close to an MVP moment as we\u2019re gonna get at the Q this year.\nBol Bol has plenty of question marks surrounding how his game and size will translate to the NBA level, but at 7-foot-2 and with a 7-foot-8 wingspan and 9-foot-7 standing reach, he can be a dominant NBA player if he continues to develop and get stronger.",
        "Wisconsin Republican lawmakers, deeming Colin Kaepernick too controversial to honor during Black History Month, blocked a proposed resolution until his name was removed from it on Tuesday.\nInstead, Republican members of the Assembly drafted their own resolution, one that did not contain the name of Kaepernick, the former NFL quarterback who ignited a national controversy that drew in President Trump by taking a knee during the national anthem to raise awareness of police brutality and social injustice. The lawmakers added the names of Mandela Barnes, the state\u2019s first black lieutenant governor, and Vel Phillips, the state\u2019s first black secretary of state.\nOne of the authors of the resolution called Kaepernick\u2019s removal \u201ca textbook example of white privilege\u201d and \u201ca slap in the face.\u201d Rep. David Crowley (D-Milwaukee) noted that to get the resolution passed, \u201cI had to get the blessing of all of my white counterparts,\u201d according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.\nKaepernick has previously drawn the vocal support of one of Wisconsin\u2019s most prominent residents, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, for his demonstrations, which began in the summer of 2016. Other players took up the cause the following season and the issue became a full-blown controversy when Trump called for owners to suspend or fire any \u201cson of a b----\u201d who didn\u2019t stand for the anthem. By the 2017 season, Kaepernick was out of the league, further outraging his supporters..\nBut the Assembly\u2019s Republican Speaker said that Kaepernick was too polarizing to include.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to recognize the contributions of literally thousands and thousands of African Americans to our state\u2019s history but also trying to find people who, again, bring us together. Not look at people who draw some sort of vitriol from either side,\u201d Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said.\nVia a 61-34 party-line vote, Republicans in the Assembly opted to remove Kaepernick\u2019s name from the resolution, and Democrats then faced the choice of abandoning their proposal or proceeding without Kaepernick. That left Crowley saying that he has \u201cheartburn\u201d over the resolution, which goes to the Wisconsin Senate on Wednesday.\nThe controversy over Kaepernick largely died down last season, when Nike even made him the focus of a prominent ad campaign. \u201cBelieve in something, even if it means sacrificing everything,\u201d he said in the campaign.\nStill, Kaepernick remains unsigned, which has angered both his supporters and many NFL players.",
        "There's a cheaper way to pay for major renovations when purchasing or refinancing a home.\nA little-known federal loan program will finance the purchase and more than $5,000 in renovations, with less money down and lower interest costs.\nThe program offering loans insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is known as the Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program.\nAlthough available since the 1970s, lenders only recently began offering 203(k) loans, after rules were changed to reduce their risks.\nLoans are available to individuals or investors for residential property with as many as four living units. The maximum loan is $124,875.\nMortgage bankers say it's the most affordable way to purchase and renovate the home of your dreams.\n\"You get a better house,\" said M. P. \"Pat\" Potamkin, president of Boulevard Mortgage Co., Northeast Philadelphia. \"It gives you the opportunity to repair and modernize, while spending less money up front. Your monthly payment would be a bit higher because you're getting a bigger loan.\"\nThe program allows buyers to get a run-down home at a low price and still qualify for a mortgage that includes all renovation costs. To obtain financing, the property would have to be located in a viable area, where the market value after renovation would exceed repair costs.\nBuyers save money because they avoid having to get a separate construction loan at rates about 2 percent higher than mortgages. They put down less money because 203(k) allows financing up to 100 percent of closing costs. Regular federally insured loans limit financing to 57 percent of closing costs under rules adopted July 1.\nBuyers can include up to six months' mortgage payments in the loan, so they don't have to make payments until work is completed and they move into the home.\n\"This is a good way to rehab property. You get the mortgage and construction loan in one shot,\" said Gerry Glavey, a HUD official overseeing housing development programs.\nMr. Glavey said HUD insures the loan before repairs are made. With a regular FHA loan, any repairs necessary to meet HUD requirements must be completed before HUD will insure the loan. In many cases, buyers must pay for replacing the roof or other repairs before obtaining a HUD-insured loan.\nThe 203(k) program will finance just about any type of renovation, provided the cost exceeds $5,000 and the work isn't merely cosmetic, Mr. Glavey said. Eligible projects include a new kitchen and bathrooms; adding rooms or a detached garage; new siding; and replacing plumbing, wiring and heating and air conditioning systems.\nThe program won't finance such luxuries as swimming pools and saunas. Mr. Potamkin said he has rejected several applications that included only repainting and wallpaper. But such cosmetic work can be included if plans include major repairs, he said.\nHere's how much a 203(k) loan would cost, compared with a regular HUD-insured loan, assuming a 9.5 percent, 30-year loan.\nSuppose you buy a home for $50,000 and plan $25,000 worth of renovations. The 203(k) mortgage would be $77,550, including purchase price and repairs. You would pay about $3,500 to $4,000 down, and your mortgage payment would be $652 a month, Mr. Potamkin said.\nCompare that with buying a $75,000 home with a regular FHA loan. The mortgage would be $76,050. You would pay $5,700 in cash and $640 a month.\nWith a 203(k) loan, you save at least $1,700 up front. For only $12 more a month, you get a modernized home that might include a new kitchen, bathroom, roof and furnace. You avoid the cost of a separate construction loan with a rate as high as 11.5 percent.\nFor homeowners considering refinancing mortgages, the program lets them save on interest costs and pay for renovation with a single loan.",
        "A white paper published by Microsoft on Wednesday concludes that Internet Explorer 8 is the fastest browser, based on benchmark testing conducted in a Microsoft lab. Microsoft's team compared the performance of IE 8 (currently available as Release Candidate 1), Google Chrome 1.0 and Mozilla Firefox 3.05.\nMissing from the roster of browsers tested were Safari and Opera (both of which claim to be the \"fastest\"), among others.\nMicrosoft used 25 popular Web sites, based on a comScore rankings, for its testing. IE 8 was the fastest browser at 12 sites, followed by Chrome (nine sites) and Firefox (four sites), according to the paper, \"Measuring Browser Performance: Understanding Issues in Benchmarking and Performance Analysis\" (downloadable here).\nThe study results aren't new; Microsoft executives have been citing them of late, including Mike Nash, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Windows product management, in an interview conducted last week. What's new is that Microsoft describes its benchmarking methodology in simple terms for IT pros who want to replicate the tests.\nMicrosoft's IE lab set up media player software to record the page loads and times. The team did not rely on the browser itself to report page load completion. Instead, the team used recorded visual cues. A video produced by Microsoft dramatizes this testing, which used media player software that's capable of \"approximately 1/30th of a second\" recording accuracy.\nThe use of visual cues seems a bit odd. In addition, Microsoft in some cases relied on additional information to determine the actual page load completion times. \"For sites on which specific visual cues aren't sufficient, we use a combination of visual cues and the ability to interact with content on a page to determine if a page is 'done,'\" the paper explains.\nWeb sites that used AJAX technology to report page load completion introduced complexity, according to the paper. In those cases, Microsoft relied on the visual cues.\nIT pros might have difficulty trying to replicate Microsoft's benchmark tests, especially when relying on visual cues to determine page load times. Moreover, the testing team used similar test hardware, loaded the sites beforehand to cache content and took other measures requiring lots of work to replicate.\nMicrosoft also tested the browsers with at most three add-ons, including Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight and Windows Media Player. While that's a typical use scenario, performance test results using those add-ons are not reported in the white paper.\nThose obsessed with browser speed differences of milliseconds doubtless may criticize the sample number of Web sites used in the study. Testing 25 Web sites may not be enough to truly proclaim one browser faster than another, statistically speaking.",
        "In a word, yes. But why is this so hard for Americans to grasp? Peter Beinart on our country\u2019s long track record of conflating religion and race.\nBut the bombers were white Americans. The Tsarnaev brothers had lived in the United States for more than a decade. Dzhokhar was a U.S. citizen. Tamerlan was a legal permanent resident in the process of applying for citizenship. And as countless commentators have noted, the Tsarnaevs hail from the Caucasus, and are therefore, literally, \u201cCaucasian.\u201d You can\u2019t get whiter than that.\nSo why did conservatives mock Sirota for being wrong? Because in public conversation in America today, \u201cIslam\u201d is a racial term. Being Muslim doesn\u2019t just mean not being Christian or Jewish. It means not being white.\nToday, Americans still often link Islam and dark skin. What\u2019s changed is which category we consider more dangerous. For much of American history, the problem with being Muslim was that you weren\u2019t considered white. Since 9/11, by contrast, one of the problems with not being considered white is that you might be mistaken for Muslim. Thus, four days after the Twin Towers fell, Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh gas-station attendant, was gunned down in Mesa, Arizona, by an assailant who had boasted of wanting to kill \u201cragheads.\u201d Last December, a Hindu American named Sunando Sen was pushed into an oncoming subway train by a woman who explained, \u201cI hate Hindus and Muslims ever since 2001.\u201d Sodhi and Sen, needless to say, weren\u2019t Muslim. They just looked Muslim because they had dark skin.\nEven the anti-Muslim epithets that have flourished since 9/11\u2014for instance, \u201csand n----r\u201d\u2014have a racial connotation. And there\u2019s evidence that Barack Obama\u2019s dark skin is one (though not the only) reason so many Americans still think he\u2019s a Muslim. In 2010, Michigan State University psychologist Spee Kosloff asked supporters of John McCain whether Obama was a Muslim. Then he asked them the same question after they filled out a card in which they listed their race. Once racially triggered, the percentage who called Obama a Muslim jumped 21 points.\nAt base, the reason it\u2019s so hard for people to accept that the Tsarnaevs are white is because, since America\u2019s founding, being white has meant, both culturally and legally, being \u201cone of us.\u201d And since 9/11, in particular, being Muslim has meant the opposite. As a light-skinned Muslim, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev straddles that divide. But he straddles it in other ways, too. He was a pothead, a devotee of hip-hop, a lifeguard, a high-school wrestler, an aspiring dentist. And yet he became, it appears, a murderer on behalf of a fanatical species of Islam. He\u2019s a type that has reappeared again and again in our history, from every faith and in every shade: an American at war with America, both intimately familiar and frighteningly alien at the same time.",

        "Astronauts lift our spirits. But can we afford to send humans into space?\nAmerica\u2019s first step in its attempt to reconquer worlds beyond our planet ended in spectacular success on Friday. An unmanned version of its Orion spacecraft soared more than 3,000 miles into space before splashing down on target in the Pacific ocean. The flight was hailed by Nasa, which says that the spaceship is destined to be the first of a fleet that will carry humans to the Moon, Mars and beyond.\nIn many laboratories and research centres, this delight was shared by scientists. A return to sending men and women to other parts of the solar system \u2013 years after the US scrapped its last manned space vehicle, the shuttle \u2013 cannot come soon enough for them.\nBut for others, the test flight was viewed as a distinctly unhappy event. Putting humans into space is futile, expensive and ultimately harmful to real science, argue researchers who believe that robot craft represent the future of space exploration and are dismayed by the US\u2019s commitment to return to expensive manned missions.\nScientists like Weinberg point to missions such as Europe\u2019s Rosetta and Philae probes which have successfully begun an exploration of Comet 67P. They argue that these missions represent the real future of the solar system\u2019s exploration. Men and women will remain expensive nuisances when it comes to discovering other worlds, they say. Relatively cheap robot probes are the future.\nThe existence of these two camps \u2013 manned versus unmanned \u2013 reveal a deep division in attitude to space exploration. On one hand, enthusiasts such as astronomer Professor Ian Crawford of Birkbeck College, London, believe that, although modern robots are capable of highly sophisticated tasks, only humans can carry out some forms of exploration.\nCrawford envisages setting up a handful of lunar colonies that would mirror the establishment of research bases in the Antarctic. From these, small numbers of astronauts would survey the lunar landscape, make observations and collect samples.\n\u201cThese missions would use robot vehicles as assistants but would depend on human intuition and leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cHumans and robots would work together.\u201d And after the Moon, targets such as Mars and possibly the asteroids would be explored in a similar manner, he added.\nThis vision is not shared by all scientists. Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, believes the cost of putting humans in space is harder to justify because of the rising sophistication of robots. \u201cIf you look at the great discoveries that have already been made in the solar system\u2019s exploration, the vast majority have been carried out by robot probes: the discovery of the great hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn\u2019s moon, Titan, and the discovery of the underground ocean on another of its moons, Enceladus, are good examples,\u201d he said.\nFrom this perspective, relying on humans to carry out scientific exploration in space is unjustified, a point emphasised by Weinberg, who describes the International Space Station \u2013 claimed by Nasa to be an orbiting multidisciplinary laboratory \u2013 as \u201can orbital turkey\u201d.\nNo important science has ever emerged from it with the exception of one cosmic ray experiment which could easily have been done on an unmanned satellite, he believes. Indeed, he adds, the whole manned spaceflight programme, which is so enormously expensive, has produced very little of scientific value.\nManned space flight crowds out real science, Weinberg argues. As an example, he points out that in 2004, president George W Bush announced a new vision of manned space missions for Nasa in which the agency would return to the Moon then head on to Mars. A few days later, Nasa revealed it was making major cutbacks in its programmes of unmanned research in astronomy because they \u201cdo not clearly support the goals of the president\u2019s vision for space exploration\u201d. In other words, to support manned missions science projects were cut back.\nEven worse, says Weinberg, was the example of the US Superconducting Super-Collider, which was designed to study the structure of matter by crashing sub-atomic particles into each other at colossal energies. Its $12bn construction, in Texas, was cancelled in 1993 because Congress decided the US could not build the SSC and the International Space Station, of which the US was the main supporter of funds, at the same time. So it chose to build the space station, mainly for political reasons.\nThis left Europe free to build its own Large Hadron Collider, at Cern, Geneva, a decade later, where scientists discovered the Higgs Boson in 2013 and are set to begin the search for dark matter and other exotic particles when the LHC reopens next year after a refit.\nBy contrast, the US ended up with that \u201corbital turkey\u201d, a decision described by Weinberg as a tragic mistake. \u201cThe only real technology that the space station has produced concerns the technology of keeping humans alive in space \u2013 which is a senseless and circular process if you realise there is no point in having humans in space,\u201d he said.\nSo are science and manned spaceflight virtually incompatible? No, says Crawford. For a start, the idea of robot efficiency is a myth, he says, as there is no substitute for putting a person into space to get things done. \u201cJust consider Philae,\u201d he said. \u201cIt did bounce when it landed on comet 67P and in the end only carried out a couple of days\u2019 work \u2013 albeit very, very important work \u2013 before it stopped working. By contrast, if we had had a bigger mission, with humans on board, the pilot would have been able to land it expertly on that tricky terrain.\nThe difference in scientific return rates from manned and unmanned missions is vividly illustrated by the Apollo 17 mission, flown by astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972, and the robot rover Opportunity which, in 2004, was dropped on to the surface of Mars and has been exploring ever since, said Crawford. \u201cApollo 17 spent three days on the Moon while its astronauts made journeys across the lunar surface that totalled 31 kilometres,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also drilled a three-metre hole into the surface, the deepest made in an object outside Earth, left a range of instrument packages behind them, and then brought back a 76kg of rock back to Earth.\nThe contrast between the scientific returns of the two approaches is revealed by examining the number of scientific papers based on the Apollo missions, says Crawford. These vastly outnumber the papers produced from all the robot missions that have been carried out on the Moon and Mars. And the number of publications based on Apollo sample is still rising. \u201cIts scientific legacy has been far greater than any other mission we have made to another world,\u201d said Crawford.\nIt was a legacy that was bought at a considerable price, however. The Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s cost $25bn \u2013more than $100bn today. From this perspective, manned missions are more than 100 times more expensive than robot missions, it is calculated. In the early days of spaceflight, there was little alternative to putting humans in spacecraft. But now robotics has achieved an advanced status and is constantly becoming more sophisticated. Martian rovers can navigate rocky terrains, drill holes and analyse soil samples \u2013 using 20th-century technology.\nIn short, the jury is still out over the future of humans in space. However, one thing is clear: we may one day return to other worlds, like the Moon and maybe Mars, but current global economic problems suggest these trips will happen later rather than sooner.\nYuri Gagarin became the first human to fly in space when he orbited the Earth in his Vostok spacecraft on 12 April 1961. His mission was followed by a series of flights - by the US and the Soviet Union - of larger and larger capsules. These culminated in the lunar landings of the US Apollo programme in the late 60s and early 70s.\nThe 12 men who landed on the Moon on Apollo spacecraft are the only humans to have walked on another world.\nAfter the Apollo programme was brought to a premature close, largely due to lack of public interest in the US, America concentrated its efforts on constructing a fleet of reusable space shuttles. These were intended to become the nation\u2019s primary means of launching payloads into orbit and were to be launched once a week when fully operational according to Nasa\u2019s ambitious timetable. The first shuttle, Columbia, was launched on 12 April 1981.\nThirty years later the fleet was retired after a total of only 135 flights - including two catastrophic accidents which destroyed the shuttles Challenger and Columbia and killed each of their seven-person crews.\nSince then, the only craft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station has been Russia\u2019s Soyuz space capsule.\nAt the same time the Chinese have pursued their own manned spaceflight programme, which began in 2003, when Yang Liwei became the first person sent into space by the Chinese space programme after orbiting the Earth 14 times in his Shenzhou 5 capsule, making China the third country to independently send humans into space.",

Mason Ramsey, the 11-year-old whose version of a Hank Williams classic has been watched more than 50 million times on YouTube (one version here) and spawned multiple remixes, will put out his first album on July 20, per the AP. Titled Famous, the EP includes a mix of new songs and country classics, including the song that made Mason an overnight internet sensation, \"Lovesick Blues.\" Raised in the small town of Golconda, Ill., Mason says his grandfather taught him to sing when he was 3, and he started performing at nursing homes, restaurants, and fairs. But it took him weeks to discover that his impromptu Walmart performance had gone viral, because his family didn't have internet access at their home.\nThey got a call from producers with The Ellen Show, and Mason was flown to Los Angeles\u2014his first-ever plane ride\u2014to be a guest on the show. He signed a record deal with Big Loud Records and Atlantic Records, and he's popped up at Coachella, Stagecoach, and the Grand Ole Opry. He'll be opening for Florida Georgia Line at their Las Vegas residency later this year. Mason's six-song EP includes covers of other Williams tunes, including \"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\" and \"I Saw the Light,\" as well as his own single, \"Famous,\" which was co-written by Florida Georgia Line's Tyler Hubbard. Throughout all the excitement of the last few months, Mason says his main goal is to keep performing until he's an old man. \"Fame is a good thing, but you have to use it in good ways,\" he says. \"Family is more important than anything.\"\nThis kid needs to pair up with the Mizzone brothers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcRI0BdioE or The Kempters brothers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCAFfX_va_I Lots of good young talent here!

        "The fire that broke out underneath elevated Metro-North tracks in Manhattan and caused crippling problems on the busy rail line appears to have been sparked by an accidental fuel spill, fire marshals said Wednesday.\nThe blaze started Tuesday night at a garden center underneath Metro-North tracks in East Harlem when fuel was spilled on a hot generator during refueling, according to FDNY fire marshals.\nThe resulting blaze burned so intensely that it damaged a center column beneath a viaduct holding the elevated tracks, forcing crews to install six temporary steel columns until permanent repairs could be made.\n168 firefighters were called to the blaze, which also engulfed construction debris and several trailers and vehicles. One firefighter suffered a minor injury when he slipped, but no one else was hurt.\nThe city, who owns the lot where the firewood and other flammable material were being stored underneath the track, says it's looking into whether the gardening business that was leasing the space violated any regulations.\nThe fire caused crippling problems on the rail line Tuesday night and forced rail officials to curtail service until at least Friday.\nMetro-North said two of the four tracks in the area of the fire were operational for Wednesday's morning rush. Trains were slowed from their normal 60 mph to 30 mph as repairs continue. The fire caused damage to a center column beneath elevated tracks.\nMetro-North encouraged customers to work from home Wednesday or to take an alternate route. Trains were operating on a modified Saturday schedule, capable of carrying about 60 percent of normal capacity. Officials said between 140,000 and 150,000 riders were affected by the delays.\nSpokesperson Nancy Gamerman said the railroad was working to restore full service by Friday, but that commuters should expect delays because speed restrictions could still be implemented.\nCommuters are advised to check the Metro-North website for updates. NYC Transit has been cross-honoring Metro-North tickets on subways.Click here for more alternative transportation options.\n\"People can look at the Saturday schedule so they know when the trains are running and plan for extra time,\" said MTA chairman Tom Prendergast.\nBut many commuters were understandably frustrated by the emergency change, which also slowed trains to a crawl for much of the day and made Grand Central Terminal look like it was in the middle of a rush hour in the middle of the day.\nNew Rochelle commuter Sam Heilman called it a \"doomsday schedule\" while Natalie Fisher lamented that her ride from Scarsdale took 2 1/2 hours, more than three times as long as her usual 47-minute commute.\nNBC 4 New York crews also felt the pain. A test ride from Grand Central to East Harlem -- normally zippy 10 minutes -- took 1 hour and 19 minutes. By evening, service seemed more promising. Crowds were much thinner at Grand Central compared to the night before, and one reporter on the New Haven line was on a practically empty train that arrived on time.\nUpdated service signs at Grand Central Terminal later in the night also promised more trains by morning.",

He faced charges that he made a threatening phone call in July against fellow seat owner William Higgins, police said.\nIn the call to Higgins&apos; attorney, the caller threatened to blow up Higgins&apos; car in retaliation for his opposition to the NYSE-Archipelago merger, according to Higgins spokesman Allan Ripp. The merger is expected to bring more than $3 million in cash and stock for each seat on the exchange, but Higgins has sued to halt the $6 billion deal, stating that the merger undervalued the 213-year-old NYSE.\nReiss, who was accompanied by his lawyer, Adam Ford, was charged with one count of aggravated harassment, a misdemeanor, and was expected to be released without bail on an appearance ticket, police said.\nA call to Ford&apos;s office was not immediately returned.\nNYSE spokesman Rich Adamonis said the exchange&apos;s senior vice-president of security, Jim Esposito, worked with law enforcement on the case, but added that it was purely a law-enforcement matter. He had no further comment.\nAccording to NYSE regulatory reports, Reiss, an exchange floor broker since 1973, was fined four times, from 1981 to 1996, for using foul language in heated exchanges with fellow floor traders and exchange officials. The fines for the four incidents totaled $8,250.\nReiss was also censured and fined $10,000 in 2001 for improper trading practices. According to the NYSE hearing panel report, Reiss was taking orders from an outside customer without going through normal exchange channels and without proper oversight.",
        "Craig Grant, founder and operator of nonprofit so-called \u2018cat sanctuary\u2019 Caboodle Ranch was arrested for the neglect and abuse of nearly 700 cats in his care. On Apr. 2, donors and former owners of many of those cats formed a class action lawsuit that will eventually be filed against Grant.\nRecords from the Lee, Fla.-based \u2018ranch\u2019 show that Grant embezzled and misappropriated donations (meant for the care of the cats) for his own personal uses: trips to Las Vegas, tickets to Disney on Ice and the Daytona 500, and personal online purchases. Grant admitted in court that he did not typically record cash donations.\nLarry and Ann Bechler \u2014 a couple involved in the suit \u2014 have, over the years, rescued feral and stray cats and given them new homes. When they brought two cats to Caboodle to be rehomed there, Grant told Larry there were 300 cats on the property, but he\u2019d like 3,000.\nBut after dropping off their cats and leaving the ranch, the couple felt that something was not right. The following day, they said, they returned to find that one of their cats \u2014 Emma \u2014 was gone. Despite making many trips back to look for her, they never found her.\nThe abuse and fraud were first discovered by an investigator with PETA.\nThe ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) is currently helping the Madison County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Madison County Animal Control manage and care for the hundreds of cats. The animals were seized in what was the largest number of cats ever taken by the ASPCA in an animal cruelty investigation.\nThe animals are being housed in a temporary shelter in Jacksonville, where a team of responders from about a dozen agencies are tending to them, ASPCA reports. Many of these animals exhibited eye infections (some of which resulted in blindness), ringworm, feline leukemia, intestinal parasites, and other conditions.\nThe situation was thrown into a grim light after cat burial sites were found on Caboodle Ranch property; and cat skulls were found in the woods nearby.",

He averaged 2.5 points and 2.9 rebounds in 10.3 minutes in 50 games with Memphis this season.\nThe 7-foot-3 Tanzania native played three seasons for UConn, averaging 10.3 points and 8.5 rebounds in 100 career games. He was the Big East Co-Player of the Year and Big East Defensive Player of the Year in 2009 and was a two-time NABC National Defensive Player of the Year.\nUConn phenoms Maya Moore and Tina Charles are two of the 30 midseason candidates for the Women\u2019s Naismith Trophy.\nMoore was the 2009 winner of the award, which recognizes the best player in women\u2019s college basketball.

        "The official movie poster for \u201cFATHER K,\u201d the documentary which looks at the Rev. Khader El-Yateem\u2019s 2017 City Council run in Bay Ridge.\nA former Bay Ridge church pastor who came close to making history when he ran for a seat on the City Council last year is the subject of a new award-winning documentary film that will be shown in a special presentation at the Alpine Theater this weekend.\nThe Rev. Khader El-Yateem, 50, moved from Bay Ridge to Florida several months ago but is expected to return to Brooklyn to attend a screening of \u201cFATHER K,\u201d a documentary chronicling his 2017 City Council run.\nDirected by Judd Ehrlich, the 32-minute documentary looks at El-Yateem\u2019s Council campaign as well as his continuing influence on Bay Ridge politics.\nThe film will be screened on Sunday, Dec. 9, at the Alpine Theater at 6817 Fifth Ave. at 6:45 p.m. El-Yateem, Ehrlich and Aidan Tumas, one of the film\u2019s producers, will take part in a question and answer session with the audience following the screening.\nEl-Yateem ran in the Democratic primary for Bay Ridge\u2019s Council seat in 2017, coming in second to Justin Brannan, who went on the win the general election that November.\nHad he won, El-Yateem would have made history by becoming the first Palestinian-American to be elected to the New York City Council. His foray into politics galvanized young people, particularly Arab-Americans in Bay Ridge, many of whom have remained active politically.\n\u201cFather K is somebody who represents an alternative way of framing difference to find common ground. We need more people like him right now in our politics, and in our public discourse,\u201d Ehrlich said in a statement.\nEl-Yateem\u2019s candidacy attracted a great deal of attention due to his ability to tap into a large constituency of Arab-Americans to win over voters. He filed more than 2,800 signatures on nominating petitions to get his name on the ballot when only 450 signatures were needed.\nEl-Yateem was born on the West Bank and came to the U.S. in 1992 at the age of 24. He moved to Bay Ridge in 1996, the same year he became a U.S. citizen. In 1998, he founded Salam Arabic Lutheran Church.\nDuring his time in Bay Ridge, El-Yateem was active in civic life, becoming a member of Community Board 10 and helping to organize the Bay Ridge Unity Task Force.\nIn May, El-Yateem left his post as pastor of Salam Arabic Lutheran Church to take on a new assignment in Florida as director of ministries for the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. But before he left, he announced that he had formed a new political club called Yalla Brooklyn.\nMembers of Yalla Brooklyn campaigned heavily for Democrat Andrew Gounardes in the race for the 22nd State Senate District, a contest Gounardes won on Nov. 6, beating out 16-year incumbent Republican Marty Golden.\n\u201cFATHER K\u201d has already created a buzz on the film festival circuit. It took home the grand prize for Best Documentary Short at the 2018 Rhode Island International Film Festival, the Best Documentary Jury Award and the Audience Award at the 2018 Austin Film Festival, and the Route 66 Film Festival\u2019s Democracy Award.\nEhrlich admitted that El-Yateem\u2019s loss in the Democratic Primary threw him for a loop.\n\u201cWhen I began this project, I believed Father K would win his primary, and when that didn\u2019t happen, I was at first unsure how to move forward with the project. But I eventually realized that I was left with an even more productive question: How does a grassroots movement continue without winning, and without its leader in a position of power? And later in production, that loss would be ratcheted up another level and beg the question whether a movement can survive without its leader,\u201d the director stated.",

        "If ever a group set out to be teeth-grindingly annoying it is Gorillaz, Damon Albarn's 'other' band. In fact they're less a band than a virtual supergroup comprising four cartoons conceived by the Blur frontman and his one-time flatmate, illustrator Jamie Hewlett. Worse, they labour under names like Noodle and 2D and converse in character when they give interviews, most of which boast little else save knowing doggerel. You couldn't make it up - except, sadly, someone has.\nStill, all of it would be just about forgivable had their eponymous debut been magnificent. It was not. Its conceit - that a group of animated characters render our obsession with an artist's age and looks redundant - was marginally more interesting than the actual songs, which notwithstanding the spring-heeled, colourful 'Clint Eastwood' were demos with pretensions. Not so this new album.\nWhere its predecessor was the work of a core group of musicians, Demon Days is Damon with some help from umpteen friends. Of these the most notable is hip hop's Danger Mouse, the producer whose namesake is a Seventies cartoon and who shares Albarn's disregard for musical apartheid, as evidenced by his highly prized Beatles-based Grey Album.\nIt, however, pales beside the bulk of Demon Days, which juxtaposes hip hop's youthful brio and invention with an intimacy that evokes Blur's most recent album, Think Tank, and a funky, sad-eyed strain of electronica. Of course such eclecticism is nothing new, but here, in contrast to its skeletal precursor, the songs are fully realised and pregnant with ideas.\nTake the impossibly rich 'Dirty Harry', for instance. It is host to the San Fernandez Youth Chorus, rapper Booty Brown from LA crew the Pharcyde, Albarn's increasingly comely delivery and, naturally, some violins. It should be a mess. It rocks. Better still is the nimble liquid pop of 'DARE', on which Shaun Ryder manages to roll back the years, and the crazed 'Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head'.\nImprobably, the latter's star is Dennis Hopper, who narrates a psychedelic nursery rhyme for adults that suggests David Lynch, Prince and David Icke have put aside their differences and formed a supergroup. 'There was only fire, and then nothing,' thunders Hopper, serving to underline the album's central message: that mankind's clock is edging ever closer to midnight. A point reinforced, head-spinningly, on 'All Alone', wherein Tricky's ex Martina Topley-Bird supplements Roots Manuva's rap with ghostly sighs.\nFor all its preoccupation with mortality, however, Demon Days oozes life from first note to last. So impressive is it that you wonder why Albarn still feels the necessity to keep it surreal and hide behind the flimsy, time-worn concept of Gorillaz. This - rather than Think Tank, or Parklife - may prove to be the Blur man's masterwork.",

        "An analysis published this weekend by the Wall Street Journal contends \u2013 as has Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the past year \u2013 that Gulf States led by Saudi Arabia are slowly but definitely beginning to change their attitudes toward Israel.\nJournalist Yaroslav Trofimov writes the impetus behind the move comes from concern over the danger coming from the Shi\u2019ite Islamic Republic of Iran.\nAs they generally do when faced with a dilemma, the Saudi leadership has found a way to smooth over the difficulties posed by the seeming discrepancy of drawing closer to Israel after decades of outright anti-Semitism and hate.\nTrofimov quotes Mohammad bin Abdul Karim al-Issa, former Saudi Justice Minister and secretary-general of the global Saudi-based Muslim World League, who he said used Islamic history to justify the move towards coexistence.\nMoreover, deputy Saudi intelligence chief Maj.-Gen. Ahmed Asiri pointed out in February that both Israel and Riyadh share concerns over Tehran. \u201cWe have the same enemy, the same threat,\u201d WSJ quoted. He also noted the U.S. is an ally of both Israel and Saudi Arabia as well.\nThe simple fact is, every Israeli prime minister since 1973 has presented some version of a final status deal to the Palestinian Authority, including several that included handing over most of Judea and Samaria. Each and every proposal was rejected by every leader of the Palestinian Authority, from Yasser Arafat to Mahmoud Abbas.\nAnd so it has continued to this day, with the PA government instead choosing to make incitement against Jews and Israel an active part of the social programming of its population from the cradle to the grave.

        "As we reflect on the lessons learned through the big-data boom, of how organisations securely capture, store and retrieve data and how they can derive value from these huge data sets, we must begin to prepare for a yet another new wave of data.\nThis data will come from millions of new Internet enabled devices, a continued push towards the use of virtualised machines and the adoption of cloud enabled business-critical applications.\nThis volume will make it more important than ever for organisations to holistically manage their data and storage more intelligently, and cloud services will be a key element to achieve this. Although the cloud has been around for a few years now, it is only recently that organisations started to really understand how to leverage it to suit their business needs. More than simply shared hard drives in the sky, today we see an increasing array of enterprise-level cloud services from virtual computers to fully realised Enterprise applications.\nHowever, what are the latest trends and services brought by the cloud and how can organisations now seize the opportunity to leverage on these new functions to enhance their business capabilities.\nWe predict that enterprises, rather than continuing to spend capital in their own datacenters, will become increasingly comfortable utilising big public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Dimension Data and RackSpace. The cloud is becoming more adept at allowing the use of data-intensive applications, e.g. SharePoint, Oracle or SAP. Currently, most organisations are knowledgeable about all of the different cloud service models (Infrastructure IaaS, Platform PaaS, and Storage SaaS) and the focus appears to be moving up the stack towards the application layer. In response, providers will likely grow their applications-as-a-service offerings, providing a broader range of alternatives to the traditional on-premises infrastructure.\nOrganisations should therefore, already start researching the right vendors, start executing their cloud strategy, and get used to managing the IaaS layer. 2015 will also undoubtedly see PaaS as its zenith. Recent trends show an increasing number of organisations are investing resources into implementing guardrails around their cloud environments so that developers can consume the cloud services in a secure and compliant manner. At the same time, they are also \u2013 or should be \u2013 either evaluating PaaS or doing a proof of concept with one or more PaaS platforms.\nIt is now time for applications and developers to enter the ring. Ultimately, this move to manage some resources in-house and put others into the cloud will reinforce the need for a hybrid cloud strategy.\nWorking with cloud service providers provides organisations with the ability to take advantage of the private cloud. In fact, a growing number of enterprises are consolidating their IT infrastructures to private/public clouds. The growing importance of hybrid cloud environments is transforming the entire computing industry, as well as the way businesses are able to leverage technology to innovate.\nOne clear benefit of a hybrid cloud model is having on-premises, private infrastructure directly accessible \u2014 in other words, not having to go via the public Internet for everything. This greatly reduces access time and latency in comparison to public cloud services. The hybrid cloud model gives the ability to have on-premises computational and storage infrastructure for processing data that requires extra speed or high availability for your business, while retaining the ability to leverage the public cloud for failover circumstances or when the workload exceeds the computational power of the private cloud component.\nBuilding out the private end of a hybrid cloud also allows for flexibility in virtual server design. Organisations can automate the entire virtual machine lifecycle to archiving older Virtual Machines (VM\u2019s) to the cloud. Some organisations are also looking at private compute clouds to provide Disaster Recovery (DR) and business resumption services for VM\u2019s that would traditionally run in the datacenter.\nUsing a hybrid cloud can also greatly facilitate employee connectivity in the workplace. In addition to employees sharing files for collaboration, companies must also integrate remote workers with core business processes, such as internal messaging, scheduling, edge protection (laptops, tablets, etc.), Business Intelligence (BI) and analytics.\nFor most Chief Information Officers (CIOs), a hybrid environment is, or soon will be, a fact of life. More enterprises will start to figure out how to use the tools that are available to expose private cloud resources to their developers. With the hybrid cloud model, IT decision makers have more control over where to process data and how much to spend on that effort as it pertains to the value for the business.\nEmbedded systems, such as Internet of Things (IoT), will continue to add to the crush of structured and unstructured data already filling company databases. The amount and variety of data will demand more advanced analytics than the ones currently available. Although there are already sophisticated data management tools that can effectively help to turn archived/stored data out great business value, we have also started to witness recently the move of data analytics to the cloud.\n\u2018Analytics with purpose\u2019 will be a guiding principle for organisations. Whether they will be launching their first BI and analytics initiatives, or leading the next phase of an existing program, organisations will have to consider the cloud as a key element of their strategy. By implementing a hybrid data analytics strategy, organisations have the opportunity to make more intelligent choices about the unstructured big data in their environment, and thus quickly take actionable steps to retrieve valuable storage space, and mitigate the risk of compliance-related issues.\nThere are clear advantages for organisations to explore all of the new and innovative uses for cloud and the cloud will be a game changer for most IT organisations. As more and more companies seek to make sense of big data, profit from IoT and make the transition to the cloud, there will always be a need for organisations to keep a holistic view of the enterprise and take control of their IT environment. This means putting more focus on the people and process aspects of this transformational change. Now is the time for CIOs to align all of their computing capabilities to business strategy, regardless of location, and derive maximum value from their capital and operational expenditures.",

        "Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Spain\u2019s most renowned poet and dramatist, in 1935. He was shot a year later by a Nationalist firing squad.\nIn the Andalusian city of Granada, a little road leads uphill, past the forested ramparts of the Alhambra, to a cemetery. The earth there is a deep, raw red, and the olive trees that punctuate it are green and gray and very old. The cemetery wall is high and long, the same color as the earth, and it is crowned with rough clay tiles.\nTwenty feet or so along the wall from its southwestern corner, there are egg-size gouges in the plastered brick. The marks are impacts from bullets. In the summer of 1936, more than a thousand people were brought to the cemetery in open trucks, day after day, to be shot against the wall by firing squads. American tourists who were staying in the little hotels down the lane later told of their horror at being awakened before dawn by the grinding gears of the trucks as they went uphill, and then, minutes later, hearing the volleys of gunfire. On August 16th, thirty people were shot at the cemetery, while down in the city the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca was taken into custody. Two days later, Lorca was murdered, along with two bullfighters and a schoolteacher.\nLorca was handsome and dark-haired, and walked with a curious, flat-footed gait that made him instantly recognizable in Granada, where he had grown up. He was a son of the local \u00e9lite; his father was a wealthy granadino landowner. But, in what was a conservative, provincial city, the family was also associated with the Spanish Republic and its liberal values; one of Lorca\u2019s sisters was married to Granada\u2019s Socialist mayor, who was among those killed on August 16th. With his 1928 book of poetry, \u201cGypsy Ballads,\u201d and his 1932 play, \u201cBlood Wedding,\u201d Lorca had become Spain\u2019s most renowned poet and dramatist. Among his closest friends were Salvador Dali, with whom he had a turbulent love affair, and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, the film director. Lorca had toured Spain since 1931 with his own theatre group, La Barraca, for the Republic\u2019s Ministry of Education. At the age of thirty-eight, and more or less openly gay, Lorca was a highly visible figure with known Republican sympathies. And that, in the Granada of the summer of 1936, was enough to get a person killed.\nOn July 17, 1936, a forty-three-year-old general named Francisco Franco had launched a military rebellion against Spain\u2019s left-leaning government. A cabal of military officers seized control of Granada three days later. In the three-year civil war that ensued, Franco and his ultranationalist Falangists received military assistance from Hitler and Mussolini, and more than half a million Spaniards were killed before the Republic finally succumbed. In April, 1939, Franco formally initiated his dictatorship. It lasted until his death, in 1975.\nA moment later, D\u00edaz cursed. \u201cThey have taken the plaque. I knew they would.\u201d He pointed to a blank patch on the wall. A few months earlier, Granada\u2019s Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory, of which he was a member, had installed a small plaque: \u201cTo the victims of Francoism who were shot at this wall.\u201d Without it, there was no sign that anything dramatic or historic had ever occurred here.\nLorca\u2019s grave, by the side of a road at the edge of a nearby village, was also long unmarked\u2014he and the bullfighters and the schoolteacher were buried there together, secretly and hastily. In 1966, Ian Gibson, an Irish-born historian who became Lorca\u2019s biographer, identified the probable site, but the bodies remained where their killers had dumped them. Then, late last year, a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, ordered that Lorca be dug up.\nGarz\u00f3n is famous for finding novel ways to use the law in the name of historical justice. In 1998, he invoked international statutes to secure the arrest, in London, of the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. This April, he opened a formal investigation into torture at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. His exhumation order was seen as a historic challenge to the silence in Spain about the Franco years\u2014the first official inquiry into the dictatorship\u2019s repression. But it set off a raging public debate in Spain. The problem is that although the Spanish Civil War ended seventy years ago, victor and vanquished were never truly reconciled.\nThe conflict lives on in unexpected ways. With Garz\u00f3n\u2019s order came the news that Lorca\u2019s own relatives\u2014a group of nieces and nephews\u2014opposed his exhumation. (In fact, they had said so before, but only now did the matter acquire urgency.) In a tersely worded press communiqu\u00e9, they said, \u201cWe reiterate our desire, as legitimate as those of other relatives, that the remains of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca repose forever where they are.\u201d This was incomprehensible to many in Spain and gave rise to all sorts of rumors\u2014that the family was embarrassed about the poet\u2019s homosexuality; that it had already privately dug him up and reburied him years before. His relatives had said that they wanted to avoid \u201ca media circus.\u201d Instead, they found themselves in a fight over Lorca\u2019s body.\nMore than four hundred thousand Spaniards spent time in concentration camps between 1939 and 1947. And over the next three decades, Spaniards continued to be persecuted for political reasons; thousands were executed by firing squad and garrotte. Half a million fled the country. In the jittery, attenuated glasnost that characterized the transition to democracy after Franco\u2019s death, however, politicians adopted a don\u2019t-look-back policy. In 1977, Spain\u2019s parliament passed an amnesty law that sealed the past in what became known as the pacto de olvido, or pact of oblivion. That\u2019s how things stood until a decade ago, when \u201chistorical memory\u201d groups, formed by the descendants of murdered Republicans, Communists, and anarchists, began to dig up some of their bodies.\nThe memory groups\u2019 activities inspired a national lobby for a reckoning with Spain\u2019s past, but the conservative Partido Popular of President Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, who was in power from 1996 to 2004, was hostile to such demands. Aznar was succeeded by the Socialist Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, however, and in 2007 Spain\u2019s parliament approved a Law of Historical Memory, which required the state to support the exhumation of thousands of mass graves. The bill also granted citizenship to the descendants of Spanish Republicans who had been forced to flee the country between 1936 and 1955. More than a million people, most of them in Latin America, became eligible, including as many as two hundred thousand Cubans. In February, the first of the new passports were issued.\nDespite the law, Spain\u2019s mass graves remain largely unexhumed. Maribel Brenes, a historian who is the president of the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory in Granada, has compiled a map of a hundred and twenty-five of them in Granada Province alone, containing twelve thousand victims. Her motive wasn\u2019t personal; one of her grandfathers had fought for Franco. \u201cIt\u2019s not about revenge, it\u2019s about documenting history,\u201d she said. \u201cWe Spaniards are hypocrites. We threw our hands in the air over what Pinochet did in South America, but no one has done anything about our own desaparecidos\u201d\u2014disappeared ones.\nLast October, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, in response to a petition filed by thirteen historical-memory associations, decreed that Franco and thirty-four others were guilty of crimes against humanity\u2014\u201ca preconceived and systematic plan of elimination of political opponents through mass killings, tortures, exile, and forced disappearances.\u201d He tallied more than a hundred and fourteen thousand victims. Declaring Spain\u2019s 1977 amnesty null and void with regard to human-rights violations, Garz\u00f3n ordered an investigation and the exhumation of nineteen mass graves, including the one believed to contain Lorca\u2019s remains.\nZaragoza managed to put a temporary halt to the exhumations. If his appeal succeeded\u2014and there was a decent chance that it would\u2014Garz\u00f3n\u2019s investigation would be dead. Garz\u00f3n responded with a pre\u00ebmptive and risky move. On November 18th, he suddenly announced that he was dropping his federal case and instead referring the crimes he had identified to Spain\u2019s provincial courts. By doing so, Garz\u00f3n kept the investigation going. There was no doubt, however, that he had suffered a setback.\nTwo days later, on the thirty-third anniversary of Franco\u2019s death, around fifty people gathered in a rooftop room in a cultural center in Madrid to express their support for Garz\u00f3n. An elderly woman who had spent time in Franco\u2019s concentration camps spoke, as did Ian Gibson. The Valencian folksinger Paco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, famous for putting Lorca\u2019s verses to music, got up and sang.\nAfterward, I went with Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and Fanny Rubio, a poet who had helped to organize the gathering, to meet Garz\u00f3n in Riofr\u00edo, a caf\u00e9 across the street from the Audiencia Nacional, Spain\u2019s high court. We sat in a corner booth. Garz\u00f3n arrived a few minutes later, with one of his bodyguards. (The militant Basque separatist group E.T.A. has targeted Garz\u00f3n for assassination; one plot, revealed last week, involved a bottle of poisoned Cognac.) The bodyguard, a young man wearing a duster, stood about ten feet away. Garz\u00f3n, who is fifty-three and has a distinctive gray streak in his hair, ordered chamomile-mint tea. For legal reasons, he could not speak to me directly about the case, but he allowed me to sit in on his conversation with Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and Rubio.\nGarz\u00f3n said that he had found himself on his own in the high-court case, without any allies. Senior officials in the Socialist government felt that he had gone too far, and were not willing to back him. But the battle was not over. Transferring the cases to Spain\u2019s provincial courts was a sort of force multiplier. Now it wasn\u2019t just up to him. Judges all over the country would be obliged to investigate, and to do so seriously, whatever their personal beliefs. Presented with a crime, they were required to look at all available evidence, including the grave sites. He had made a thousand Lorcas possible.\n\u201cWhat about Lorca\u2019s relatives saying they don\u2019t want him dug up?\u201d Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez asked.\nSerrano S\u00fa\u00f1er died in 2003, at the age of a hundred and one, but his son, Don Fernando Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er y Polo, agreed to meet me at my hotel in Madrid for tea. Don Fernando, who is in his seventies, wore a sharply tailored English suit. His mother and Franco\u2019s wife were sisters. He remarked that Spain\u2019s Falangist movement had been \u201cmisinterpreted,\u201d and that he found Garz\u00f3n\u2019s inquiry into the past \u201ca little depressing.\u201d \u201cIt is very pitiful that we are like we are, all these years later,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo of my father\u2019s brothers were fusilados and buried in a mass grave outside Madrid. In other words, not all the victims are Franco\u2019s.\u201d Don Fernando said that he admired the way that Americans had reconciled after their Civil War, and he proceeded to recite, from memory, Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address in Spanish.\nThe closest thing to a national civil-war monument in Spain is Valle de los Ca\u00eddos\u2014the Valley of the Fallen\u2014centered on a vast subterranean basilica that Franco ordered built in 1940. Burrowed deep into the granite of the Sierra de Guaderrama mountains outside Madrid and topped by a five-hundred-foot stone cross, the monument took almost twenty years, and the labor of thousands of Republican prisoners of war, to complete. Although it was billed as a resting place for the dead of both sides, and contains the remains of some forty thousand Nationalists and Republicans, it commemorates nothing so much as Franco\u2019s megalomania and triumphalism. When he inaugurated the necropolis, in 1959, Franco spoke about how his enemies had been made to \u201cbite the dust of defeat.\u201d In the main hall, the only marked tombs are those of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falange Party, and, since 1975, of Franco himself. (The other remains are in sealed catacombs.) Not surprisingly, Valle de los Ca\u00eddos has become a sanctuary for Spain\u2019s diehard Falangists.\nLast November 20th, the anniversary of Franco\u2019s death, his followers came, as they always do, to pay their respects, although, in accordance with the new Law of Historical Memory, police had been ordered to prevent openly Fascist displays. Franco\u2019s tombstone was a slab of granite in the floor, etched with only his name and a cross. There were bouquets of red and white roses, and a wheel of carnations. Several well-dressed older people bowed their heads. A small group of plainclothes policemen stood watching. A man in a red jacket approached, gave a Fascist salute, and dropped to one knee. He then stood up, and saluted once more. One of the policemen came trotting over, but did nothing. A moment later, two more men, with closely cropped hair and small, trimmed mustaches, met at the tomb and gave simultaneous Fascist salutes of their own.\nLorca was buried less than five miles from Granada, on the outskirts of the village of Alfacar. Following the route that Lorca\u2019s executioners took, Juan Antonio D\u00edaz and I drove first to the nearby village of V\u00edznar. We parked in a little square next to an eighteenth-century archbishop\u2019s palace, which, in 1936, was turned into a military command center. It will soon be converted into a five-star hotel. A small road, cut like an elbow around a deep gulch, led to Alfacar past what had once been a children\u2019s summer camp called La Colonia. In the summer of 1936, La Colonia was used as a holding center for the victims of the Nationalists\u2019 purge in the area. (There were other execution grounds, including the city cemetery.) According to Gibson, Lorca arrived as a prisoner before daybreak on August 18th, as did the bullfighters and the schoolteacher. They were then driven a short distance down the road, and taken for a paseo\u2014a stroll.\nI was returning from the dry lands. Down in the hollow lay the vega, swathed in its blue shimmer. Through the recumbent air of the summer night floated the fluttering ribbons of the crickets.\nWe saw rectangular stands of white poplars, as well as the shining roofs of new industrial warehouses, strung along the way to Lorca\u2019s birthplace, the village of Fuente Vaqueros. This view, minus the warehouses, must have been one of the last things Lorca saw.\nOn May 29th, the Granada judge assigned to rule on Lorca\u2019s exhumation recused herself from the case. This would have sent it to the Supreme Court of Spain, which was viewed as unsympathetic to Garz\u00f3n. (Two days earlier, the court had agreed to hear a lawsuit, filed by a far-right group, charging Garz\u00f3n with \u201cprevarication\u201d in the course of his investigation.) But, on June 9th, Granada\u2019s prosecutor filed a grievance appealing the judge\u2019s decision, potentially returning the case to her. Granada\u2019s historical-memory association, meanwhile, declared that if Spain\u2019s courts continued to stonewall its efforts, it would request that the graves be opened as an \u201carcheological site.\u201d Amid these developments, Lorca\u2019s family was silent.\nLaura Garc\u00eda Lorca, the poet\u2019s niece, has a breathtaking view of the Alhambra from the living room of her apartment, on the top floor of a building in central Granada. A former actress, with the large, expressive brown eyes of her late uncle, Laura heads the Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca Foundation. On the day I visited, she appeared overwrought. All of the media attention, she said, had been extremely stressful.\nLaura\u2019s tone turned sarcastic. \u201cBut no, it seems it is conservative to not open a tomb, and progressive to open it. They have even said we are homophobes. This is defamation, just plain crazy. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s that there is a prurient interest in this search for Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. And it is logical; he was a symbol. But we want him to be respected. For us, the prospect of exposing further the degrading circumstances in which he was murdered is very disagreeable. To violate him further would be, for some\u2014very unpleasant.\u201d Laura wept.",
        "After beating the Delhi traffic, I finally stopped at Gajraula on the Delhi-Nainital road for coffee, a welcome break. Having escaped the city rut, sipping coffee felt like one had recalibrated the mind, very refreshing. Over the years, Gajraula has emerged as a good mid-way stop with most of the top fast food brands present there. Tadka, a famous dhaba, makes some of the fluffiest naans. The thought of Munsiyari brought an instant smile on my face.\nA reclusive hill town, Munsiyari is tucked away behind the tall hills of Kumaon. Literally in the lap of the snow-capped Panchchuli peaks, I had seen a picture a photographer friend had clicked a couple of years ago. And boy! going by the photo, it looked spectacular and picture perfect. It had been my intent to drive up to this paradise for some time now, and finally I was on the road and the time had come. There were two routes to get to Munsiyari from Delhi. One was Delhi\u2013Rampur\u2013Rudrapur\u2013Bhimtal\u2013Almora\u2013Chaukori\u2013Thal\u2013Munsiyari and another was a deviation from Rudrapur to go to Tanakpur\u2013Pithoragarh\u2013Chaukori and follow the same road to Thal and Munsiyari. I had chosen the former.\nFrom Gajraula, however, the next big town was Moradabad. Having taken the bypass at Moradabad, the next to come was Rampur. Dusty, narrow, crowded and dirty roads greeted me. But thankfully not for long as I turned left towards Nainital (the turn is right in the middle of the town, opposite the railway station and is very easy to miss, so do look out carefully) from there. It was a two-lane road from there to Rudrapur (the first town in the state of Uttarakhand). As I turned, my mind was filled with some nasty memories. The distance from Rampur to Rudrapur is about 50 km, crossing Bilaspur in between. But this section for many years has been any driver\u2019s nightmare\u2014deep potholes (big enough for a loaded truck to sway dangerously), dusty tracks and errant traffic (some of the bikes manage 60 kmph, I don\u2019t know how and I also saw a few Maruti 800 cars fly past). I have been driving on this road for 15 years now and have never seen this stretch tarred and cared for. Some say it is because this is nobody\u2019s baby (border stretch between Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand). Maybe it\u2019s true! But guess what, this truth is not just limited to India. I have driven extensively all over the world and typically, most border crossings, about 50 km stretch this side and the other, are always in pathetic condition. I had noticed this at China-Kyrgyzstan border, Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan crossing and many more. So, Uttar Pradesh-Uttarakhand crossing was not unexpected. But yes, one so hoped that this wasn\u2019t the case.\nDriving at snail\u2019s pace, the 50 km stretch took nearly 3 hours. Tired and irritated, I stopped for some tea. The next town was Haldwani (about half an hour away), Kathgodam followed and the green hills were in my face. The air was fresher and the road began to take a few sharp bends, ascending steadily with the Gaula River flowing in the narrow valley on the right. It was the month of May. The Gaula was frail, but the vegetation was green and one couldn\u2019t miss the whiff of freshness. Traffic was unusually thick. It was evening time and being Saturday, I saw many outstation and local registered cars zip past hurriedly, making their way to Nainital. Thankfully, I turned right shortly after Ranibagh, headed towards Gaula and further ascended to Bhimtal. The road was well tarred; was a brisk ascent. The evening lights of Kathgodam and Haldwani bejewelled the night sky. I stopped at a wide bend to soak up the silence. The view was gorgeous. Got back behind the wheel and headed to Bhimtal. I had booked myself at a hotel between Bhimtal and Bhowali. Drove straight in, checked into the room, freshened up, poured myself a glass of whiskey and sat by the window to watch the night sky and the lights from Bhimtal illuminate the valley. The feeling was sinking in\u2014I was in Kumaon, the land where Jim Corbett had lived. I had grown up reading Jim Corbett\u2019s stories about the Champawat man-eater and other man-eaters of Kumaon\u2014the stories kept coming back. Thereafter, had a quiet meal and called it a night\u2014had been a hard day and a good drive indeed.\nThe next morning, a blue sky indicated that it would perhaps be a bright day. The sun was already up and I was all set to begin the day\u2019s drive. I had a rather long drive of around 285 km, now it doesn\u2019t seem much, except that in the hills, this might take anywhere between 6 and 8 hours! Steadily made my way up to Bhowali (that lies on a ridge line) and further onto a frequented and busy road to Garampani that set the tone for the day. The road felt like a bit of a race track with so much traffic, you either kept pace with the flow of traffic or were relegated to a side, with every second vehicle honking to tell you how terrible you are. I chose to keep pace, thankfully. Ahead of Garampani, towards Almora, one noticed a fenced hillside. The road beneath was untarred. It didn\u2019t take time to figure out that the hill slope was unsteady and prone to minor landslides. By then, the road had begun following the Kosi River (which flowed on the left). This feature of unsteady hill prevailed over next 10 km or so, fenced in spurts. While I drove past, my eyes also gazed at the hill slopes on the other side, across the Kosi River\u2014bare and steep. I wondered if they always were like this. It struck me that Kumaon was known to be facing an acute water shortage. The hill slopes in this section explained why quietly.\nAbout 10-15 km short of Almora is a small bridge across the Kosi at Kwarab. The road crossed the bridge; further ascent towards Almora. From this point onwards, the valley got narrow and deep, with the road moving at a height on one side and featuring terraced fields on the other side, literally slicing the hill slope from top to bottom. A string of villages punctuated the slopes. A closer look at the slopes on the other side and I noticed that there were very few that had crops being grown, they were mostly barren and uncultivated. A quiet Kosi flowed in the valley below. This didn\u2019t look good. There were hardly any trees and it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine the shortage of water. And as one drove closer to Almora, the town unfolded. The houses seemed stacked like match boxes on the hillside, so close, one next to the other. Dangerously close I thought; god forbid, an earthquake and they would collapse like a pack. Scary thought\u2014hope it never happens. I took the bypass road and reached a junction, from where I took a deviation to Sheraghat. The route ahead was Sheraghat-Berinag-Thal and finally, Munsiyari.\nAbout 10km on the road towards Sheraghat, one came upon a crowd of people. I had reached Chitai. The Golu Devta Mandir at Chitai is a much revered place of worship for the people of Kumaon. It is a small temple on a hillock by the side of the road that breaks the monotony of the pine trees and winding roads. The red sacred cloth tied to trees and bells spruced up the surroundings. Bells are the mainstay of most temples in the hills and this one had its bunch to showcase\u2014small, big, tiny, huge\u2014I could go on to use many more such adjectives. Tiny shops close to each other selling souvenirs, bells, and things for puja, among others, lined the road on both sides.\nAhead of Chitai, began a short descent through pine woods to Barechina. The lonely woods with only an occasional stream or two for company were sliced by a small, single road that patiently wound itself around the hill. A quick stop for tea, and I drove off to Dhaulchina. All these areas are in the surrounds of the Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary. I was told that sighting leopards or deer was not uncommon on this route. For now, I was content and happy\u2014self, road and forests!\nDhaulchina is located at a slight height on the ridge line. The deep valley on the right of the road was filled with fog that morning. The mid-morning sun was trying to peep through the clouds, without much success. Small and cosy, this little village has all quaintness of a pahadi village, though it is by the roadside. One could see tiny shops selling aloo, pakodi and tea, some carved balconies of homes built at a height, water flowing in a channel by the road, smoke billowing out of a few chimneys here and there, and some pahadi men with their woollen jackets and topis sitting around and chatting, trying to catch the morning sun.\nNot to be besotted, I drove further towards Sheraghat. By now, the road was beginning to seem a little long. But behold, just while I was getting bogged down by the monotony, a few snow-capped peaks peeped out of the horizon, to infuse a fresh lease of energy. Sheraghat is located in the valley, a biggish village. A large stream in the village roared next to the village. From Sheraghat, Berinag is about 35 km away. A continuous ascent, the road cut through tall pine forests following a deep valley on the right. The growing chill in the air was unmissable now; it was time to take out that warm jacket!\nBerinag is on a ridge line. The town is spread right across the ridge line, spread straight and thin. As I pulled up to Udiyari bend, it was 3:30 pm in the afternoon. And what a sight that awaited me\u2014a panoramic view of the snow-capped mountains\u2014wow! I parked by the side of the road to admire this jaw-dropping beauty, rolled down the windows to let the cold air fill the car and just stood silent.\nThereafter, began the descent to Thal. A bridge over the Purvi Ramganga River marks the entrance to Thal. A quick stop for chai, I realised it was still 67 km to Munsiyari. It was already 4:30 pm. I had no time to waste. The road, carved along the hillside, was followed by a valley that was taking turns to be narrow and wide. Occasionally, a few snow-caps would offer a motivating view. The Purvi Ramganga was a steady companion for most parts. With crystal clear waters the river\u2019s gurgle echoed far and wide. There were hardly any vehicles on the road. Felt even better since I had the entire road and scenery to myself.\nEn route one passed Birthi Falls, a straight tall waterfall that freezes in winters, I was told. Honestly, I had no time to appreciate it as I was running late and didn\u2019t want to miss the evening hues at Munsiyari. After about 45 minutes, almost around 6 pm, I could see a largish settlement with a few lights lit. It felt reassuring to have nearly reached. While I drove the final leg, I didn\u2019t notice the hills around owing to the darkness setting in. Short of entering the town, I stopped by the road for bio-break. I stepped out of the car and I froze! Literally and metaphorically, towering snow-clad peaks were staring at me! And how close and how majestic! Simply spectacular and unimaginably close. The Panchchuli peaks, a group of five peaks ranging from 6300 to 6900 metres in height, stood guard, literally, in front of the town of Munsiyari. The peaks glowed in the night light, making the view even more gorgeous. I checked into a hotel, but couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off the peaks.\nMunsiyari is the last bastion on the Indian side. It borders Tibet and is mainly inhabited by Johari Shauka tribe that traditionally traded salt with the people from Tibet. It is a cultural hub with a museum to celebrate the Shauka culture, many non-descript trails to walk on, stone houses with raised balconies, quiet road and sleepy villages\u2014all against the magical backdrop of the Panchchuli peaks. The place is flooded with hikers and climbers as it is the starting point of many high altitude hikes\u2014Milam and Ralam glaciers being the famous ones.\nI spent the next four days wandering around Munsiyari and drove back on the same route. The hills of Kumaon have left an indelible mark\u2014the drive was breathtaking and has only given an added impetus to go back to the hills. It\u2019s just a matter of time now, I guess!",
        "STAR WARS: LAST SHOT - A HAN AND LANDO NOVEL (8 out of 10) Written by Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older. Published by Del Rey Books. 368 Pages. Find it wherever books are sold 4/17/2018.\nSome of my favorite books in the history of Star Wars have been the triple shots of adventures starring Lando Calrissian and Han Solo, published in the late 1970s and early 1980s. With Solo getting written by Brian Daley and Calrissian written by L. Neil Smith, the books were short, fun, and had an adventurous vibe that maybe some of the other more serious books in the canon lacked.\nIt's been a while since we've had a book like that.\nDaniel Jos\u00e9 Older gives it to us in spades. This novel is split into three different timelines for our heroes. The timeline that dates the furthest back belongs to Lando and his droid L3-37 and evokes all of the same spirit as the original Lando books. L3 even feels very much like Vuffi Raa at times, Lando's droid companion in those. She's a droid concerned with things other droids typically aren't and might even be something else entirely. The middle chapter involves Han Solo after he took possession of the Falcon. He's with Chewie, naturally, getting in over his head with Sana Starros and a bizarre job that involves kidnapping a tiny crime boss and stealing a...thing. The present, set after the events of Chuck Wendig's Aftermath trilogy and the Battle of Jakku, brings Han and Lando back together as they sort through a villainous plot that involved both of them, however obliquely, in those previous timelines.\nThat villain is Fyzen Gor, a Pau'an butcher of a surgeon with a plan so mustache twirling that he seems immediately cut from the same cloth as Lando's Legendary arch-nemesis, Rokur Gepta.\nAs Han, Lando, and Chewie work to unravel Gor's plot, they take on a motley crew of help, including a Twi'lek that Lando is involved with, a surly ugnaught, a kid of a pilot who plays their music too loud, and an Ewok who happens to be one of the best tech-slicers in the galaxy.\nThey proceed to fumble and bluff their way through everything until the climax that reminded me in many ways of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, but not in a bad way. Lando definitely gets to be the Spock character, jetpacking across space into a hairy situation where an artificial intelligence has gone against its programming.\nI'll admit, this book isn't going to be for anyone who insists that they have to take their Star Wars too seriously. It's fun. There were honestly moments in the book I was laughing out loud, which is rare for me as a reader. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have its small touching moments as well. In fact, it cut right into me to see Ben Solo as he is portrayed in this book. Hearing \"Uncle Lando\" call him \"Little Starfighter\" damn near brought a tear to my eye.\nAnother thing I loved about the book was that it was heavy in the prequel references. We get a Gungan supporting character, a Pau'an villain and another of other moments to tie all three eras of Star Wars together.\nIn recent years, I've loved how the hero's journey stories that we get in Star Wars have matured to a point where it's not just about crossing out of adolescence, but also how to be the adult you need to be. It's relatable to see Lando struggle with commitment, with settling down. It's doubly relatable to see Han's self-doubt about being a father. How does a scoundrel who barely see worth in himself, despite his arrogant bravado, become a good father?\nBen's treatment here gives us clues to his eventual fate as well. His parents, while trying their best, feel absent. And they're willing to be absent for what they view as a greater duty. Everything that takes them away from Ben is in service to the New Republic. In this book, Ben is he's left with (potentially murderous) droids as caregivers while Han deals with Fyzen Gor and Leia deals with a crisis in the New Republic. Even though Ben's reasons might be entirely in his unconscious, this absence gives a compelling reason for his hatred of the New Republic and all it stands for. It's the thing that took his parents from him, even when they were there.\nNaturally, there are a lot of years between toddler Ben here and the Ben who so scares Luke Skywalker so much that he considers the unimaginable, so anything can happen between here and there. But the groundwork for this idea is there.\nThis book is a lot of fun. It's absurd in all of the right ways and captures the spirit of reading an entire trilogy of those short books from days gone by. Older brings a charm to the prose that feels both contemporary and nostalgic to those old books. The Han and Lando we see here are rendered faithfully and the universe gets a little weirder and more wonderful for it. I'm actually excited to re-read this book after seeing Solo: A Star Wars Story, because I have no doubt there will be connections and conversations to be had about it. And, as an introduction to L3-37, it's a great one. She's a fascinating character that I wish I had more time with in the book.\nIt's well written, it's breezy fun, and it put a smile on my face. What more do you need from an old-school Star Wars book? It doesn't change the universe, but it certainly makes it weirder and more wonderful. That's why I'm giving it an 8 out of 10.\nYou can get it now on Amazon or wherever books are sold.\nFor more in-depth conversations about this book and all things Star Wars, be sure to tune into the Full of Sith podcast every week or follow me on twitter.",
        "This weekend the Texas Legislature approved HB 2741, a vehicle licensing bill that included a provision to increase penalties on trucks that are hauling overweight loads on our roadways. The House voted 135-9 to approve this measure after differences between House and Senate versions of the bill were ironed out in a conference committee. The Senate approved the measure as well, but the recorded vote is not available as of this publication. All that is missing now for our roadways to become a little bit safer is for Governor Rick Perry to apply his signature.\nCurrently the law on overloading trucks is hardly even a slight deterrent to those who wish to cheat the system to gain an unfair business advantage by carrying overweight loads. The average fine for violation of existing law is less than what you and I would pay for a speeding ticket - about $150. Under the new law, there is a sliding scale of penalties that range up to $10,000 for the first offense. These fines are doubled on the 3rd offense. The bill also includes fines for trucking companies with repeat offenses, and in some cases, for shippers who are demanding heavy loads be carried.\nOverloaded trucks are destroying roadways in Texas at a record rate. Roads that are designed to last twenty to thirty years are being turned to rubble in five to ten years. In addition to the huge maintenance expense, these damaged roads are a massive safety hazard causing damage to other vehicles, accidents and even fatalities. Often accidents are also caused by drivers not being able to control the overloaded trucks in an emergency situation leading to increased highway deaths. This is why it is so important for Gov. Perry to sign this bill into law.\nIt has been an interesting process, watching this series of bills make their way into its final form and passage. I am reminded of what someone once said about the making of sausage. You can enjoy eating it, but you do not want to watch how they make it.\nIn a bill like this, there are many competing interests who are looking out for their own well-being. County governments want money for road repairs as does TXDOT. At the same time, the many areas of the trucking industry want to protect their ability to do the vital job of hauling our nation's goods to market. Taxpayers want their investment in our roadways to be protected and drivers want safe roadways so they and their families can drive safely. Many of these interests are mutually exclusive and negotiations can be difficult.\nOf course, the trucking industry is not monolithic in its wants and needs either. There are oil company truck companies, logging trucks, garbage haulers, milk and other ag related trucks, ready mix trucks and dump trucks. Trying to keep all of these competing interests happy is a very difficult task for legislators in drafting a final solution like the one passed.\nIt brings to mind, the game of Whack-A-Mole. As soon as you get ready mix companies happy, up pops the oil industry. Satisfy them and up pops logging companies. Make them happy and county governments pop up looking for their money. Then taxpayers start yelling for enforcement and safety on the roadways. As each mole pops up, they must be dealt with and brought on board. In some cases the bill was made stronger. In others it was diluted.\nIt took a great team of legislators working long hours to bring this bill to passage. Initial legislative drafts were introduced by Representativies Allen Fletcher (R-Cypress), George Lavender (R-Texarkana), James White (R-Woodville) and Senator Robert Nichols (R-Jacksonville). House Transportation Committee Chairman Larry Phillips (R-Sherman) also played a crucial role in ushering this bill through the jungle of the legislative process.\nAs the session was winding down to its final days, it appeared we might not be able to bring it together and get a bill passed. But then, Senator Tommy Williams (R-The Woodlands) threw down the gauntlet from the senate and passed an amendment to a budgetary funding bill that tied the money being allocated for road maintenance to the passage of the increased fines in this bill. Without this bill's passage, the nearly half a billion dollars allocated to road maintenance would have been stripped from transportation and given to social services programs.\nSuddenly things started moving forward again. From time to time it still appeared the entire bill might die, but in the end a bill was passed that is better than the current situation. It is by no means a perfect solution, but it moves the ball forward and deals with an important issue while making our roads a little safer and protecting the investment of tax dollars in infrastructure.\nAll that remains is for Governor Perry to make this into law. It is up to you to let the Governor's office know this bill is good for Texas and good for Texans. Call or write Governor Perry and ask him to protect our roadways by signing this bill into law.",

Schneider Electric, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, announced today ahead of the Arab Future Cities Summit Dubai that the Middle East and North Africa, and especially the GCC, are spearheading the USD 2.6 billion global Smart Cities market.\nAs mega-trends such as connectivity, mobility, social media, and new digital business models transform the world, city governments across the region are harnessing the power of the Internet of Things to drive innovation, meet citizen needs, and enhance energy and infrastructure development.\nWorldwide, the Smart Cities market is set to reach USD 2.6 trillion by 2025, according to a recent report by Grand View Research. Cities are the nexus for the Internet of Things, with global connected things set to nearly double from 11 billion in 2018 to 20 billion by 2020, according to Gartner.\n\u201cThe Middle East and North Africa, especially with initiatives across the GCC, are spearheading global Smart Cities innovations to drive economic competitiveness, and enable safe, convenient, and prosperous communities,\u201d said Caspar Herzberg, President of Schneider Electric Middle East and Africa, ahead of the keynote \u201cFuture-Proof Smart Cities and Powering the Digital Economy\u201d.\nDuring the keynote, Schneider Electric will exchange best practices in how governments leverage the Schneider Electric EcoStruxure\u2122 architecture to optimize Smart Cities.\nNaya Raipur, India\u2019s first greenfield integrated Smart City, uses 100,000 connected things to deliver citizen-centric services.

        "The propaganda that the BJP is no longer concerned about Brahmin interests has been reinforced by the lack of representation of the community in key slots in the party and government.\nOne reason why the government ensured that Atal Bihari Vajpayee was accorded a grand farewell nationally is that BJP chief Amit Shah is keen to assuage disillusioned Brahmin voters. The propaganda that the BJP is no longer concerned about Brahmin interests has been reinforced by the lack of representation of the community in key slots in the party and government. The big two in the party, Narendra Modi and Shah, are non-Brahmins. Besides, there is an extraordinary preponderance of Thakurs as chief ministers. There are Thakur BJP Chief Ministers in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Manipur. Apart from the six \u2014 Vasundhara Raje, Raman Singh, Yogi Adityanath, Trivendra Singh Rawat, Jai Ram Thakur and N Biren Singh \u2014 many assume that Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is a Rajput. In fact, he is an OBC.\nMoUs between India and representatives of another country are signed customarily in Delhi\u2019s plush Hyderabad House. But such is the Central government\u2019s aversion to the Aam Aadmi Party that a message was conveyed to the Delhi government that the MoU on the twin-city agreement between Delhi and Moscow should be signed at another venue. Visiting Russian minister Sergey Cheremin discovered at the last minute that he had to travel all the way to the Town Hall, in the heart of crowded old Delhi, to countersign the agreement with Delhi\u2019s Deputy CM Manish Sisodia. Unsurprisingly, he was late. Meanwhile, several MoUs with the Russians could not be formalised during President Vladimir Putin\u2019s visit because they had to be first translated into Hindi.\nRecently, there was a farewell tea party for Sonia Gandhi\u2019s close aide S V Pillai at 10 Janpath, organised by Pillai\u2019s Keralite colleague P P Madhavan. Pillai was reportedly reluctant to leave the Capital, hoping that he could manage to stay on like V George, who still visits Sonia\u2019s office periodically. Pillai, a former government employee, had joined Sonia\u2019s office in 1998, when she was leader of the Congress parliamentary party, and he remained with her when she was leader of the opposition and later head of the National Advisory Council. PAs of the Gandhi family, whether R K Dhawan or V George, have always commandeered great respect from Congresspersons, who know their importance as gatekeepers to the boss. In his hey days, Pillai used to be addressed as \u201csir\u201d and \u201csaheb\u201d by Congress ministers.\nIn the Congress, the fortunes of members can go up and down. For instance, when actress Divya Spandana was first put in charge of the party\u2019s social media cell, she was riding high and congratulated for injecting a new spark and aggression into the party\u2019s social media profile, putting the BJP on the backfoot. But now Spandana\u2019s role has been downsized following some tweets, such as calling the Prime Minister a \u2018chor\u2019 and getting a photo-shopped visual to make the point, which embarrassed the party. Whether or not she momentarily resigned in a huff, Spandana\u2019s role has been cut down. Nikhil Alva, son of veteran Karnataka Congress leader Margaret Alva, has been put in charge of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Twitter handle.\nSome attribute Spandana\u2019s fall from grace to media in-charge Randeep Surjewala, who is keen to promote his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Priyanka Chaturvedi and wants the social media cell to be part of the overall media division and not a separate unit. Others feel Spandana is a victim of Karnataka politics. Jairam Ramesh, also from Karnataka, who is in charge of coordinating the Congress campaign for 2019, was instrumental in elevating Alva. Interestingly, just a year ago, Ramesh himself was down in the dumps after his injudicious remark about the Congress facing an existential crisis. He has bounced back in favour. And will Alva remain a blue-eyed boy considering that he was responsible for Rahul\u2019s recent tweet suggesting, on the basis of a video, that Nitin Gadkari claimed that the BJP made tall promises it couldn\u2019t keep before the 2014 election? The tweet turned out to be a dud, with Gadkari pointing out that the video was on abolishing toll taxes in Maharashtra, a promise duly kept.\nNot all in the Congress view BSP chief Mayawati ruling out an alliance with the party in Madhya Pradesh as a setback. Though the BSP commands 6 per cent of the vote share in the state, some believe that the proposed alliance would have put off potential upper-caste voters, who are disenchanted with the ruling BJP but fearful that a Congress tie-up with Mayawati would translate into reservations even in promotions. If the Congress wins the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections on its own steam, it strengthens the party\u2019s position greatly for the 2019 polls.",

        "NDP MP Margaret Mitchell speaks in Ottawa in February, 1983.\nCarol Off is host of As It Happens and author of All We Leave Behind: A Reporter's Journey into the Lives of Others, winner of British Columbia's National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction.\nI flew to Ottawa one cold February morning in 1987 filled with anticipation, eager to start my first real job as a reporter. No one warned me that I was actually travelling there in a time machine, back to an age when girls were girls and men were men. It soon became obvious.\nWhat I learned in the few years I worked in the nation's capital was that power and privilege allow for the most boorish behaviour imaginable. And before anyone suggests that I'm talking about the olden days, gather round and I'll tell you stories that seem all too familiar today.\nSeasoned veterans of the Parliamentary Press Gallery had advised me not to rely too much on Question Period or news conferences but to get out into the bump and grind of the Ottawa social circuit and make connections. I was chuffed when a senior member of prime minister Brian Mulroney's inner cabinet circle, a popular senator, invited me to a \"5 to 7\" reception at his Ottawa pied-\u00e0-terre (I'm not naming him because he's deceased and unable to respond to this story).\nI don't recall the purpose of the gathering, but the senator's townhouse was abuzz with Ottawa insiders, a target-rich environment for journalists, and there were several of us there. As the party wound down and the crowd thinned, two other reporters and I agreed to share a cab home. The senator came to the door to say goodbye. He shook hands with the men, then turned to me. Suddenly, he had me pushed up against the wall while he groped and tried to force his tongue into my mouth. My colleagues stood by, aware of what was happening but not knowing what to do. I fought the senator off, grabbed my coat and fled the house, dishevelled and confused.\nThe two men with me in the taxi said they were shocked by what they had just witnessed. I don't recall their names but I do recall what they said: They cautioned me to be careful what I did about it.\n\"I hope you're not planning to report him,\" one of them warned. \"Just remember what happened to Judy Morrison.\"\nThat was enough to send a chill down my spine.\nJudy was the highly accomplished host of the weekly CBC radio program The House. About a year before I arrived in Ottawa, she became the object of scorn and ridicule when she dared to expose the appalling behaviour of the prime minister's press secretary, Michel Gratton. If you wanted an interview with Mr. Mulroney, you had to go through Mr. Gratton, and Judy had made several requests. He told her finally that she could have a one-on-one only if she agreed to go out on \"a date.\" A reporter from the Ottawa Sun heard about Mr. Gratton's offer, confirmed it with Judy and reported it in the newspaper.\nNDP MP Margaret Mitchell rose in the House of Commons a few days later to demand an explanation from the Conservatives. But instead of contrition, the House erupted into uproarious laughter, a rare moment of shared mirth among political foes. The mockery spread into the press gallery above, seemingly everyone enjoying the yuck fest. Judy was mortified, and the reaction should have shut down any further discussion.\nBut a 20-something cub reporter with The Canadian Press welled up with anger as she watched the men chortle. She decided to act.\nThis was Kathryn Young's first job as a reporter, and she had been thrilled to be assigned to the Hill. As a junior staffer, she worked the late shift and often had to call the PMO press secretary after hours. Mr. Gratton was the gatekeeper, the most powerful person for any journalist trying to report on federal politics. He was a crusty, swaggering rogue, popular with the mostly male press gang. Columnist Val Sears once said he looked as though he had been raised by wolves.\nKathryn was leaving the Ottawa press club late one night when Mr. Gratton offered to share a cab. She was pleased \u2013 this must mean he accepted her as a peer \u2013 and eagerly accepted. She soon learned his real intentions.\nIn the taxi, Mr. Gratton mauled her. When they arrived at her apartment, he wouldn't let her go. Kathryn was confused, worried about the implications for her job. She invited him up, intending to tell him she was engaged to be married and hoping to repair any potential damage to their professional relationship.\nInside the flat, Mr. Gratton attacked, pinned her down in a chair and tore open her blouse while she fought his advances. She yelled, \"No!\" several times and insisted strenuously enough that finally, in a huff, Mr. Gratton departed. Kathryn called a friend to come stay with her. She kept the encounter a secret \u2013 until that day, 18 months later, when she watched the men in Parliament howl with merriment over the revelation that Mr. Gratton had offered access to the PM in exchange for possible sexual favours. She promptly gave her account to the Ottawa Sun.\nBoth Judy's and Kathryn's stories appeared in the news in diluted versions. The reports still should have caused alarm about Mr. Gratton. And they revealed that other women had also complained about his behaviour. But nothing came of it, except a grudging apology from Mr. Gratton. The Mulroney damage-control team went into high gear but they needn't have bothered: The media did the job for them. Columnist Don McGillivray wrote: \"Michel Gratton has doubtless suffered, perhaps horribly,\" but the affair is now settled with the apology. The Globe and Mail's George Bain wrote: \"It may be that I talk with the wrong people, but in three days I met no news person who said he or she thought the press secretary had done anything more reprehensible than to be a somewhat macho self.\"\nIn 2014, following revelations that female MPs had been sexually harassed by male colleagues, I asked Kathryn and Judy to come on As It Happens and tell their full stories for the first time, hoping to illustrate how long this abuse had been going on. Kathryn talked about the terror she felt in her apartment when Mr. Gratton attacked her: \"I thought, 'This is it. I'm going to be raped.' \" The encounter was violent and scarring. Judy described the reaction to their complaint. She said Mr. Mulroney's staff intimidated them and called them in for probing questions. Someone dispatched a powerful lawyer to dog the two women around the Hill. \"I was running up and down back staircases to avoid him,\" Judy recalled.\nBut their fellow reporters were worse. With a handful of exceptions, Kathryn's colleagues continued to mock and ridicule her, including her own bureau chief. She was ostracized in the press club. Her professional ambitions were crushed. Judy described how she was bullied and harassed, her CBC bosses in Ottawa shunting her off to a small office and hoping she would go away. The two women were branded as troublemakers; their tattered careers stood as totems for those who might contemplate making the same mistake. Neither woman ever fully recovered from the events, and both eventually left journalism. But neither regrets what she did.\nMr. Gratton died in 2011, after penning a memoir titled So, What Are the Boys Saying? \u2013 the question Mr. Mulroney asked of his press secretary at the end of each day.\nAs for me, female friends in Ottawa said I would get used to the antics, but I never did. Men on the Hill would proposition, tease and harass. They shook hands with other men and then indulged in the quaint custom of a kiss on each cheek for the women. And if they could cop a feel mid-peck, all the more fun. I met a senior bureaucrat at a reception and asked him for an interview. He sent word to me later: Yes, please come by \u2013 but wear a shorter skirt.\nWomen were tolerated, many even respected, for their work. But Ottawa was a shark tank. A number of women learned to swim with the sharks without being bitten. But they were fair game. You accepted that or you moved on.\nI escaped from Ottawa in the same time machine in which I had arrived. As the decades went by, I just presumed things had changed. How could it still exist in that warp? But all the stories I'm hearing now are the same. Young women in politics \u2013 whether they're reporters, staff members, aides or MPs \u2013 say they have to watch where they go, with whom they talk, what they wear, what they say \u2013 just as we did. Michelle Rempel, Catherine McKenna and Rona Ambrose have used their senior positions to denounce the offensive behaviour, but to no avail. The allegations of the young woman who says Rick Dykstra assaulted her are shockingly similar to the story Kathryn Young tells. Except Kathryn revealed her name, whereas the identity of the 20-something victim of today is undisclosed. How's that for progress?\nI often berate myself for not having had the courage to speak out 30 years ago. And I'm convinced many men shared the view that this was wrong. But we all came to accept that this was a reality we could not alter. The status quo was too useful and too comfortable for too many. I doubt the offenders even see the effect their behaviour has on the lives, careers and psyches of the women they take for granted.\nIn recent days, we've heard about proposed legislation and new codes of conduct in the works. I will leave that to lawmakers. But if the words \"Remember Judy Morrison\" could no longer be a warning but instead a rallying cry, that would be a start.",
        "An insight into the effect of global warming in the Antarctic is revealed in a report behind a new exhibition at the Australian National Maritime Museum.\nThe preliminary report into an expedition led by scientists from the Australian Antarctic Division and the Boston Oceanographic Institute suggests significant changes are occurring at the lowest level of the food chain, which is a vital source of sustenance for seabirds, seals and whales.\nData from the expedition in 2010 is still being collated, but a selection from the 20,000 images to be used as a reference point for monitoring future change will go on show in Sydney from next Saturday.\nOf observations made at Cuverille Island, the report notes: ''Another interesting feature of the island is the presence of two plants, a moss and a grass, crucial indicators of warming weather. Warming is evident in the moistness of the air in this area of the world's driest continent.\n''Rain is now not uncommon and whilst this may encourage plant life, it is probably detrimental to the health of many breeding birds, which get damp and cold.\n''This moistness also results in more snow falling and this too can affect the breeding habits of nesting birds when it falls during their incubation period, burying their eggs in the cold snow.\n''At Peterman Island we saw penguins soaked by the rain, and this is a location where the more northern gentoo penguins are increasing in numbers at the expense of the Adelies [penguins], which are more suited to colder conditions.\n''The glaciers draining the ice caps of the islands and the mountains of the peninsula are shrinking too. This has resulted in the formation of more icebergs and a greater run-off of fresh water.\nExpedition leader Michael Aw said the team witnessed an increase in gelatinous herbivores called salps possibly at the expense of phytoplankton, which are consumed by fish and krill.\n''The balance in the herbivore elements of the food chain determines the types of larger animals that can be supported \u2026 there are suggestions it is changing from one that supports krill and its predators [seabirds, seals, whales] to one that may result in more fish and possibly squid,'' he said.",
        "When you\u2019re in the market for a car, you can feel pressured to buy on a holiday weekend because carmakers typically offer great new car incentives and discounts around that time. If you missed buying a car over the July Fourth weekend, don\u2019t worry. Car deals for the rest of July, and in some cases, the rest of the summer, are rolling out and there are some great new car deals available. Why are summer new car sales and incentives so strong? Car companies and dealers are trying to sell down their stock of vehicles from the 2015 model year because the 2016 cars, trucks and SUVs are on their way.\nFord has a massive summer sales event going on now through Sept. 30 The current Ford deals include no-interest financing for up to six years, and you\u2019ll still have room in your budget for summer fun because they won\u2019t start your loan payments for 90 days. This offer is available on models including the 2015 Ford C-Max, Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, Taurus, Escape, Explorer and Expedition, depending on what region you\u2019re in.\nIf you like the idea of skipping payments for a while, but want something more rugged than what Ford is offering, the Jeep summer clearance event allows you to delay your loan payments by 90 days on all Jeep models, so you can enjoy an open air ride in the Jeep Wrangler now, or delay your payments on a new Jeep Grand Cherokee and be all set for when the snow starts to fall. The Jeep summer clearance event continues through Aug. 3.\nHonda is another automaker with deals that will last longer than your beach-week tan. Now through Sept. 7, Honda has low interest rates of 0.9 percent for two to five years (the length of the loan term depends on the model) on models like the Civic, Accord and Odyssey.\nThere\u2019s no need to hustle to take advantage of Cadillac\u2019s summer offers, which are good through the end of August. Cadillac deals include $2,000 cash back or zero percent interest for up to five years on models like the Cadillac ATS and CTS, as well as up to $4,000 cash back on the XTS and $3,000 cash back on the SRX.\nThe only thing that drives better than a BMW is a BMW you got a deal on. Through the end of July, BMW is offering 1.9 percent financing on pretty much every model in its lineup from the 2-Series on up to its X line of SUVs. With that low financing rate, you\u2019ll be able to put some money away for the speeding tickets you\u2019ll inevitably get.\nA BMW may not fit into your budget, even with a great financing deal, but buying a Volkswagen gets you into a German car at a more affordable price. During the Volkswagen Model Year End Sales Event, you can not only take advantage of no-interest financing on models like the 2015 Volkswagen Jetta, Passat, CC, Beetle, Tiguan and Touareg, but you can also get a $1,000 pre-paid Visa card when you buy or lease a 2015 Tiguan, Jetta or Passat.\nCheck out our car deals page for more of the latest and best car deals.

        "I became obsessed with the idea of playing a game of billiards with the late philosopher David Hume. But how? I stopped in the Los Medanos College Laboratory where biology students were preparing to roll out a cadaver to study and dissect.\nI made my way over to a rarely used section of the lab, which dealt with time lapse and accidentally backed into a button on a warped wall, which caused a blinding flash.\nIncredibly, I found myself in a large room with a single, over sized billiard table. The room was strangely Baroque in style. The door opened slowly and in walked a man wearing a brocade coat and a powdered wig. His nose was bulbous, his chin squat, yet there was a gentle quality in his face.\nCould this be...the philosopher whom I vehemently disagreed with on paper? The thinker who seemed to devote his life and literary talents to bury historic Christianity? The man who stated that \"Religious truth is illusory and that there was no such thing as a miracle?\"\nWithout a word, we each picked up a pool cue. \"Three-ball in the side pocket,\" I declared. \"NO!\" he exclaimed with rising passion, \"You cannot say with certainty that the cue-ball striking the 3-ball will cause that ball to move and drop into the side pocket.\"\n\"But,\" I protested, \"the cue ball would be the cause to effect the 3-ball to move. In your own teachings you state that A, the 'cause,' always precedes B, the 'effect' and that there is constant conjunction for we always see 'A' followed by 'B,' so my statement is valid.\"\n\"But,\" Hume thundered back with his Scottish accent, \"you have never witnessed the event that you intend to accomplish, specifically this particular 3-ball moving upon the impact of the cue-ball and propelling it into a specific side pocket, so therefore you cannot make such a statement.\"\n\"No?...then watch this!\" I pulled back the cue-stick, and thrust it forward with full power. It hit the cue ball which launched it forward where it struck the 3-ball with a resounding thud. A blinding flash filled the room.\nI found myself standing on a deserted street in the ancient city of Vallejo. Walking through the ruins, I found a structure with a sign that proclaimed, \"Teeter's Restaurant and Pool Hall.\" Before going inside I was greeted by the owner at the doorway. A little boy walking down the sidewalk pointed and said to his father, \"That's Billy Teeter, the greatest pool player in the world!\"\nTeeter's eyes met mine. \"Let's play pool,\" I said with authority. We circled the pool table, cues in hand. Teeter pointed to the table with his cue stick. \"Three-ball in the side pocket,\" he announced. \"No No\" I protested...\"causality is not a quality in the objects we observe but is rather a 'habit of association' in the mind produced by the repetition of instances of A and B.\"\nTeeter's face tightened. \"Three-ball in the side pocket,\" he said through clenched teeth.\" No...NO! Hume says that while we do have impressions of contiguity, priority and constant conjunction, we do not have any impression of necessary conjunction. Causality is not a quality in the objects we observe but is rather a 'habit of association' in the mind produced by the repetition of instances of A and B. The misplaced belief of necessary connection is....\"\nAs a good philosophical story must abide by the principles, the reader is required to come to his own conclusion.",

        "Against the odds, Auburn Smith, 16, has become a nationally ranked wheelchair tennis player. She will participate in the USTA-ITF Junior Wheelchair Tennis Camp.\nPORT ORANGE \u2014 Auburn Smith was born into sports.\nHer first name largely derives from her father's love of Auburn University, where he has attended football games since childhood.\n\u201cShe loves it when we go to the football games and they're chanting her name,\u201d said Jimmy Smith, her father.\nShe was also born with spina bifida, the most common permanently disabling birth defect in the United States, according to the Spina Bifida Association. Literally meaning \u201csplit spine\u201d in Latin, spina bifida occurs when a baby is in the womb and the spinal column does not close all the way.\nAcross the United States, roughly eight babies are born with spina bifida or a similar defect of the brain and spine every day.\nAgainst the odds, Smith, 16, has become a nationally ranked wheelchair tennis player. She will participate in the USTA-ITF Junior Wheelchair Tennis Camp in Mission Viejo, Calif. from July 28-Aug. 2.\n32 athletes from ages 12-18 from across the globe, spanning 10 states and six countries, will attend the camp to improve their skills and receive instruction from some of the top coaches in the world.\nThis will be the Smith family's fifth straight summer trip to Southern California.\nSmith primarily enjoys getting to see the friends she has made over the last five years. The campers spend virtually the entire six-day period together, including an annual trip to a theme park.\nDan James, the USTA's national head coach and national manager of wheelchair tennis, will be one of the primary instructors at the camp. Even though he has coached in four Paralympic games, he says the camp is his favorite week of the year.\nThe soon-to-be junior at Spruce Creek began playing tennis at the age of 7. Since then, she has worked with Nancy Olson, who runs the \"Tennis Everyone!\" program for Easter Seals of Volusia Flagler Counties.\nOlson helped Smith gain exposure across the country since, in her opinion, Florida is not recognized as a wheelchair tennis hotbed.\n\u201cI wanted her to have the example of how good she could be and to see really good tennis,\u201d said Olson, a two-time Paralympic silver medalist in wheelchair tennis.\nSmith was named a National Youth Representative for Easter Seals on Oct. 25, 2012, becoming the first national representative from the Easter Seals affiliate in Volusia and Flagler counties.\nNot only has Smith had a positive influence on others with disabilities but also with her own family. Jimmy gave up a job in business management to become a registered nurse in honor of Auburn.",
        "When the technology was founded: Around 1860 when the first QWERTY-keyboard was developed.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: The keyboard is in practically every device there is - even to the mobile device and television remotes. For some time, the keyboard was restricted to simply the word processor and the computer. It took a while for mobile devices to take advantage of the QWERTY keyboard style on handsets.\nHowever, innovative technologies allow a wider breadth of input into computers and mobile devices. But even with touch technology, arguably spurred on by tablets and touch-screen phones like the iPad and iPhone, the keyboard still reigns as the most natural and innate input device for all to use.\nWhen the technology was founded: Microsoft Office was first released in fall 1990 for Windows 3.0.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: Without doubt, Microsoft Office is one of the most used, and understandably the most expensive office and productivity suite of programs on the market. Because of its userbase in the hundreds of millions, ranging from large corporations to governments, it is almost as widely used as Windows itself.\nBut the one thing that hinders it the most is that bar the Office:mac edition, it only runs on the Windows platform. As so many people use Office as a document standard, it all but forces out competitors as its market dominates further.\nThere is a good reason why it has become what it is. Not only does it dole out everything that one needs in an office suite, but has always maintained its version history to each major release of the platforms it is supplied on; both Windows and Mac OS X.\nOffice will, in my opinion, no doubt survive for the next 20 years on any platform that Windows becomes or evolves into.\nWhen the technology was founded: 19th century, part of Charles Babbage's Difference Engine.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: To put it simply and bluntly, how else would we get stuff out of the computer?\nPrinters are absolutely vital to our everyday living and working. Without them, there would be no such thing as a 'papertrail' and there would be nothing to screw up in a moment of frustration to throw at your co-workers. The fact of the matter is, unless we suddenly all ditch the very notion of paper altogether - which is unlikely to ever happen, then printers will remain a vital part of our technologically progressive society.\nWhen the technology was founded: The 'modern' television was born in 1926.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: Radio and television has supported the world in times of crisis and in times of joy. Even though technological developments have changed the way we listen to radio and in particular television, the window to the world is still ever present in all but every household in the modern world.\nThough on-demand media and 'broadcast control' technology like Sky+ and TiVo has brought an extra dimension of command to our television broadcasts, the key element is the set itself. It's not going anywhere any time soon.\nWhen the technology was founded: In the late 1950's and early '60's.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: Though you may not think it, optical media is still one of the most predominant of all storage mediums, besides the hard drive.\nThe problem the optical disc faces is the rise of non-optical reading equipment in modern technologies, like smartphones and more specifically, many netbooks. Though, this should not deter fans of optical media for the simple fact that so many alternatives are available for say netbook users, such as the download.\nBut nevertheless, optical media in its simplest form is slim, compact - hence the name, and easy to transport. Sure, it isn't as small or as sleek, or necessarily as to capacity as some flash drives, but they are far cheaper to manufacture and constantly evolving into larger storage mediums. Just compare a 700MB CD-ROM to a 4GB Blu-ray.\nWhen the technology was founded: For the person on the beat, and not in a vehicular setting, around 1973.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: Not only are mobile phones a means for communicating via voice from one person to another, but the technology surrounding these 'sacred-in-modern-times' devices has long been a platform to expand existing technology.\nOnly in our lifetimes, the Generation Y have seen cellphones develop into smartphones; a platform for which technologies are added to and the experience of the device enhanced significantly.\nThe very notion of cellphones becoming moulded into the human design are all but nonsense. Mobile phones nowadays are beyond 'making a phone call' and more a personal assistant-like device, allowing communications beyond the phone call or text message.\nCellphones may not last another 20 years, but smartphones will.\nWhen the technology was founded: Dial-up internet, predating the dawn of the web. Around the 1950's at the earliest.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: The fact that in recent months, dial-up internet access was used in some of the rebelling Arab states, like Tunisia and Egypt, when their governments cut off access to web-based media, shows how important dial-up access is as an ultimate 'backup' solution.\nFor nations and states who have yet to reach Western modernity, in technology and culture, repressed by their own states, dial-up access is still used across vast areas where broadband and faster internet access is unavailable.\nWhile for many in the Western world, broadband and fiber connectivity may be at the forefront of our minds, still a great number of those in the developing world rely on dial-up connectivity.\nWhen the technology was founded: 1995. Not quite 20 years old, though.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: Java is integral to so many devices and applications, on hardware and software systems alike. From Blu-ray players to mobile devices, cars and desktop operating systems and cloud-based applications, Java is absolutely everywhere.\nAnd for that reason alone, it is all but indispensable to our every day working and leisure time, and is why Java will - not might - last another 20 years at very least.\nWhen the technology was founded: 1980 onwards, at least in popular culture.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: Email has vastly shifted from a static and restricted technology, chaining employees and consumers all over the world to a desktop machine, to a dynamic and fluid operation where it is common practice to send and receive emails on the go.\nEmail is here to stay, and won't be going out of fashion any time soon. Even Facebook and social networking and social media won't kill off the backbone of all Internet communications.\nA blast from the 1991 past: A look at 10 technologies - hardware and software - which have, and could last another 20 years.",
        "Before battling Superman and joining the Justice League, the Caped Crusader was under the direction of movie maestro Christopher Nolan and Blade (1998) writer, David S. Goyer, in the epic Dark Knight Trilogy, which is still the best thing to happen to the character. In this Rewind Review, we journey back to 2008 to take a look at the best of the bunch, The Dark Knight.\nThe Dark Knight is the follow-up to Batman Begins (2005), and sees billionaire Bruce Wayne continuing his fight against the criminal underworld as masked vigilante, Batman. But nothing can prepare him for the rise of the Joker, an unstable force of nature that pushes Batman towards confronting the consequences of his actions.\nCo-written by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, the movie plays out like a crime thriller, rather than a superhero film, with Batman attempting to thwart a psychopathic terrorist in clown makeup that knows exactly which buttons to press.\nChristian Bale returns as the Dark Knight and continues his brilliant performance to near perfection. He manages to bring all three of Bruce\u2019s personalities a sense of realism, whether that\u2019s as Bruce Wayne in the public, the real Bruce with Alfred, and of course, Batman himself.\nThis time around, Bale brings gets to explore a more fragile side to the character, stepping away from the anger of Batman Begins. His relationship with Alfred feels deeper, and even provides a few laughs, but not as many as the films antagonist.\nThe Clown Prince of Crime is played by the late Heath Ledger, who won a post-humus award for his performance. Though we learn very little of who the Joker actually is, he more than makes up for it with a terrifying appearance and an unpredictability that sets the audience on edge whenever he\u2019s around.\nThis Joker is less concerned with making jokes than he is causing chaos on the streets of Gotham in an attempt to show just how mad the people really are, whether he\u2019s threatening to blow up boats or pushing someone way beyond breaking point. As he explains, he\u2019s a \u201cdog chasing cars\u201d just doing things because he can.\nIn a welcomed return, both Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles as Bruce\u2019s trusted butler Alfred Pennyworth, and head of Wayne Industries and tech provider, Lucius Fox.\nThere\u2019s also a handful of new additions to the cast, with Maggie Gyllenhaal taking over as Rachel Dawes, and while she\u2019s a welcomed addition, her character doesn\u2019t have much to do and only serves as a plot device for certain events to move forward.\nAnd finally, Aaron Eckhart is introduced as Harvey Dent, a district attorney on the edge of breaking point. His introduction is brilliant a sets him up as a man to be trusted, \u201cthe face of Gotham\u2019s future.\u201d But after a terrifying interrogation scene, it becomes apparent that he\u2019s not a stable as one would think.\nThe story starts off relatively normal with Batman focused on the mob, continuing the continuity from the animated movie Batman: Gotham Knight, before the Joker arrives on the scene. With the mob becoming desperate, they begin to turn towards the Joker and his extreme methods.\nThe only issue with the story is its focus, cutting between Batman\u2019s story arc and the Joker\u2019s dealings, making this less so a Batman movie and most of a Batman/Joker film. This isn\u2019t a bad thing by any means and gives Heath Ledger more time to shine.\nThe story continues to build up and intensify as the Joker slowly becomes more influential, providing some expertly played twists and turns until the shocking finale where anything could happen.\nThe action increases pretty significantly as well and it is nothing short of spectacular. From the expertly crafted opening heist to the pulse racing car chase, the action feels grounded but has a grand scope to it where the entire city feels at risk of being sucked into the madness.\nAs the story and the action heats up, the tension is pushed to extremes, with it becoming unclear whether Batman or the Joker will succeed. It\u2019s pushed to breaking point as the two meet for the movies best scene, with the Joker being interrogated by Batman while trying to explain how he sees the world and how similar they both are.\nIt\u2019s at this point that parents realised that this is definitely not the Adam West or Tim Burton era, with the film pushing a 12A certificate beyond what is suitable. In many rereleases, The Dark Knight Trilogy is now officially a 15, which is a much better choice.\nWriter and director, Christopher Nolan, has made a name for himself as the thinking man\u2019s director, crafting intriguing plots that draw you in and always leave everyone surprised. He also utilises symbolism effectively in this film to help convey messages about characters mental stability and the overall tone, which is only heightened with the epic soundtrack.\nBack from his work on Batman Begins, Hans Zimmer creates the score and manages to outdo everything he previously created. Utilising the theme from the first movie and shaping it into something different, it is a masterpiece, with a highlight being the themes for both Joker and Harvey Dent.\nIt\u2019s quite easy to say that The Dark Knight changed the way that Warner Bros and DC developed their films, but it goes much further than that. Lots of filmmakers realised they could take their stories seriously and not need to water everything down to suit a younger demographic. Unfortunately some have taken this as \u201ceverything needs to be dark\u201d, rather than be respectful of the source material and capture the spirit of the character.\nOverall, this is easily one of the greatest adventures for the caped crusader and one of the best films ever made. With a gripping story, amazing actors and an incredible score, The Dark Knight managed to break out of the sequel curse and raised the bar for comic book adaptations, and movies, could be.\nPurple Revolver rating: 5/5. An absolute masterpiece.",

        "NEW YORK (AP) | Starbucks Corp. began selling its new instant coffee online Tuesday, ahead of a nationwide launch to coincide with the company\u2019s first major ad campaign.\nCustomers will be able to buy packets of the new coffee in Starbucks\u2019 Seattle and Chicago stores March 3 and the rest of the company\u2019s U.S. stores in the fall when the advertising begins. Online orders will start shipping in March.\nChief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said the gourmet coffee chain wants to change perceptions of both its own affordability and the quality of instant coffee.\n\u201cThis is not your mother\u2019s instant coffee,\u201d Mr. Schultz said at an \u201cunveiling\u201d event for analysts and reporters in New York.\nCalled Via, the water-soluble product sells in packets of three for $2.95 or 12 for $9.95 - $1 or less per cup. Just Colombian and Italian Roast varieties will be available at first.\nIn addition to customers in Starbucks stores, Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp. shoppers in Seattle and Chicago will be able to buy the packets in March.\nMr. Schultz said the new product will help boost traffic in the afternoon and evening when customers are more mobile and possibly looking for just one cup of coffee rather than a full pot.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to replace the morning ritual,\u201d he said.\nThe company will have to replace the perception that instant coffee is more Maxwell House than coffee house.\n\u201cWe realize the connotation of instant in America and around the world is an uphill battle,\u201d he said.\nTo fight that battle, Starbucks is launching its first major advertising campaign, which will include a video on YouTube explaining the difference between Starbucks instant coffee and the old standbys.\nThe instant coffee has already created a stir among the company\u2019s many followers and critics.\nCritics say the move smells of desperation as the chain closes locations in the U.S. and overseas and cuts nearly 1,700 jobs.\nMichael McFall, president and founding partner of Biggby Coffee - a premium coffee chain of about 100 stores mainly in the Midwest - said he follows the company closely so he knows what his biggest competitor is up to.",
        "Facebook has admitted to deleting the accounts of Palestinian activists and journalists at the behest of the Israeli government as well as the accounts used by the former leader of Chechnya at the command of Washington in an active campaign of international political censorship.\nThe social media company, which has more than 2 billion active users worldwide, has also been systematically removing hate speech and other \u201cillegal\u201d content from its platform in Germany.\nFacebook, which has nearly 4 million active users in Israel, has been engaged in a \u201ccensorship rampage\u201d against activists and journalists who oppose the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory according to the Intercept\u2019s Glenn Greenwald.\nFollowing the Israel-Facebook summit, ten administrators for the Arabic- and English-language Facebook pages for the Palestinian Information Center, with more than two million followers, had their accounts suspended, seven permanently. Facebook also briefly took down the page run by Fatah, the largest faction of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, when it posted a picture of Yasser Arafat holding a rifle.\nMost recently the former head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, had both his Facebook and Instagram accounts deleted at the behest of the US last month. According to Facebook, it had deleted the two accounts, which had approximately 4 million followers, after the Trump administration had placed Kadyrov on a financial sanctions list.\nThe move against Kadyrov sets the precedent that allows the US government to silence the social media accounts of any foreign politician or official who may voice opposition to US interests by placing them on a sanctions list.\nAlong the same lines as the US and Israeli government\u2019s censorship campaigns, the German government adopted a new law in October that bans \u201chate speech\u201d and other \u201cillegal\u201d content on social media outlets by threatening the companies with a possible $56 million fine if they do not quickly remove offending posts.\nCoinciding with the new law, Facebook opened a \u201cdeletion center\u201d in Essen, Germany employing 500 censors to sort through posts and delete comments, videos and photos that violate the company\u2019s rules. The first such deletion center in Germany was opened in Berlin and now employs 700 people.\nRichard Allan, Facebook\u2019s European Vice President for Public Policy, reported last year that 15,000 posts had been deleted in a single month for violating Germany\u2019s hate speech laws.\nIn what was reported to be the first use of the new social media hate speech ban, Beatrix von Storch, the deputy parliamentary leader for the right-wing extremists Alternative for Germany, had her Twitter and Facebook pages blocked after she posted a racist comment disparaging Muslim man. The offending post was promptly deleted by the social media companies\u2019 censors.\nWhile Facebook\u2019s campaign is justified publicly by targeting right-wing extremists and autocrats, the real aim is to use these powers against anyone who is branded an \u201cextremist,\u201d in particular political opponents of the financial oligarchy. Facebook\u2019s censorship campaign, carried out in coordination with Western governments, is of a piece with Google\u2019s efforts to block access to left-wing and antiwar web sites by demoting their pages in search results, resulting in traffic drops by as much as 75 percent.",
        "FABIO CAPELLO is celebrating a happy hat-trick as he leads England into the last match of the season at Wembley today.\nThere is imagination and confidence and we have players who have improved a lot.\nNew faces. New imagination. New confi dence. The Italian\u2019s change of mood has been a long time coming.\nA year ago he was heading towards South Africa and a disastrous World Cup. He admits for the fi rst time he was surprised by how badly England performed.\nEngland have certainly made strides this season and Capello knows he goes on trial again when the team gets to Poland and Ukraine next summer.\nHe said: \u201cI am happy with the recent performances, the change of styles and the young players who have come in.\nA new side has started to form. Joe Hart, Jack Wilshere, Ashley Young, Scott Parker and Darren Bent, who all face Switzerland today, have freshened up what was a tired England squad.\nNo-one more than Wilshere captures the mood of Capello\u2019s new England. He has been the big success story and captain John Terry praises Wilshere, who misses the European Under-21 tournament to rest for next season.\nTerry said: \u201cI see him as a huge part of our senior set-up and we need to nurture him and look after him. It is unfortunate for the Under 21s yet he has been different class for us.\n\u201cHe has a major role to play. If we are looking towards the Euros next summer then Jack has to be protected. I\u2019ve had a quick chat with him about the situation and he is disap- pointed not to be going to the Under-21 fi nals although at the same time he feels part of us.\n\u201cWe need to get with him rather than him feel anyone is against him. What he has shown in the last few games has been incredible.\n\u201cNot many of us expected him to step up the way he has. He will have played 60 games in his fi rst full season.\n\u201cEveryone wanted to see fresh faces and he is the one who has stood out. I like the way he glides past opponents. It is very Zola-esque.\n\u201cHe is his own man and I watched him against Barcelona for Arsenal and he has such confi dence for some- one so young.\n\u201cHe is small, strong, agile, sharp, quick and glides. He always wants the ball which is a good sign. Under pressure it is sometimes easy not to want it, although not Wilshere.\nCapello likes Young who, he says, has transferred his club form to the international stage.\nHe is also putting faith in Young\u2019s Villa team-mate Bent. He said: \u201cWhat I like is that he is focused in front of goal. The box is where he likes to be.\nIt is vital England win today. It will send them into the summer top of the group, happy and relaxed.\nCapello said the players have been like \u2018children\u2019 this week after taking time off between the end of the league season and this vital Euro tie.\nCapello knows now not to hammer them physically ahead of the fi nals in another year\u2019s time. It was one of his big mistakes a year ago.\nThe side picks itself with West Ham\u2019s Parker holding in front of Wilshere and Lampard, with Bent and Young up front.\nHis only dilemma is who to choose between Adam Johnson, Theo Walcott, James Milner and Stewart Downing as the wide player.\nTerry said it took the team months to move on from the South Africa disappointment.\n\u201cWe have turned the corner at last,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt uncomfortable taking the captaincy back off Rio Ferdinand and we have spoken at length about it.\nTalk is cheap and Capello continues to struggle with his English. At yesterday\u2019s conference he continually asked his interpreter to explain.\nWhat did make sense from him was that a new era is developing. Last summer\u2019s World Cup is a bad memory and Capello talks warmly of new faces, imagination and confidence. It\u2019s his hat-trick of hope.\nEngland are never going to play like Barcelona, who lit up Wembley a week ago. Maybe never win a trophy.\nBut at the national stadium today England intend to send another sell-out crowd into the summer with a smile. At last.",

        "PAUL JAY, SENIOR EDITOR, TRNN: Welcome to The Real News Network. I\u2019m Paul Jay in Washington. And in Washington on Thursday, President Obama delivered what he said was a new vision for US foreign policy in the Middle East. Here\u2019s what he had to say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nBARACK OBAMA, US PRESIDENT: The United States believes that negotiations should result in two states with permanent Palestinian borders with Israel, Jordan, and Egypt and permanent Israeli borders with Palestine. We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states. The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves and reach their full potential in a sovereign and contiguous state. As for security, every state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat. Provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism, to stop the infiltration of weapons, and to provide effective border security. The full and phased withdrawal of Israeli military forces should be coordinated with the assumption of Palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign, non-militarized state.\nJAY: Now joining us from Ramallah, Palestine, to give his views on President Obama\u2019s speech is Omar Barghouti. Omar is independent Palestinian researcher, commentator, and human rights activist. He\u2019s a founding member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel and a Palestinian civil society boycott, disinvestment, and sanctions campaign against Israel. So, Omar, what is your reaction to the speech in general, and then more specifically about Israel and Palestine?\nOMAR BARGHOUTI, INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST: I just want to comment on one specific line in this speech which may say it all. President Obama said that the Arab democratic spring has made al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden irrelevant even before he was executed by US forces. There\u2019s another person who has become almost irrelevant by the Arab democratic spring, and that\u2019s President Obama. I don\u2019t know how long it will take him to realize that, but he\u2019s becoming less and less relevant to people in the region. As everyone in the West was waiting by their TVs to watch him, hardly anyone cared in our region, in our part of the world\u2013maybe Netanyahu, and maybe Mahmoud Abbas. But for most people I know of, including commentators, analysts, and so on, hardly anyone cared, really, what Obama had to say, because (A) no one expected him to say anything new, and, lo and behold, he did not say anything really new. Two, even if he said something new, who cares?\nJAY: You say what President Obama says is somewhat irrelevant in the region, but at the same time, the United States is still a major funder to Israel, and both in terms of money and military support; also for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries\u2013Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and so on. It\u2019s still the behemoth in the region. So why wouldn\u2019t people care what President Obama has to say?\nBARGHOUTI: Oh, absolutely. No one is denying that the US is the main partner of Israel in committing its crimes against Palestinians and other Arabs. No one denies that US complicity is the reason why we have so many dictatorships in our region. So no one is denying that. But I\u2019m saying no one has held his or her breath waiting for Obama to give us anything positive that can help the democratic social justice spring in the Arab world, and least of all in the occupied Palestinian territory. The fact that Arab peoples are taking initiative on their own and deposing regimes that have been supported by the US administrations for decades says it all, really, that the US administration does not realize that it is not part of the solution. It has not been part of the Arab revolutionary changes. In fact, those changes were very much against US establishment\u2019s interests in the region, \u2019cause those dictators have been serving US interests, the establishment interests, very well, not the people\u2019s interests, in the US.\nJAY: Well, do you think there\u2019s some recognition of this fact that this has been the history of US foreign policy in the region and that President Obama\u2019s saying it\u2019s time for a new vision? And here\u2019s an example of at least the kind of words he was using.\nOBAMA: So we face a historic opportunity. We have the chance to show that America values the dignity of the street vendor in Tunisia more than the raw power of the dictator. There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self-determination and opportunity. Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise. But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be. Of course, as we do, we must proceed with a sense of humility. It\u2019s not America that put people into the streets of Tunis or Cairo. It was the people themselves who launched these movements, and it is the people themselves that must ultimately determine their outcome. Not every country will follow our particular form of representative democracy, and there will be times when our short-term interests don\u2019t align perfectly with our long-term vision for the region. But we can and we will speak up for a set of core principles, principles that have guided our response to the events over the past six months. The United States opposes the use of violence and repression against the people of the region.\nJAY: So do you think that at least this is a different kind of positioning?\nBARGHOUTI: You know, that doesn\u2019t work with Arabs in general. We don\u2019t fall for that, because he got interested in the vendor when the vendor won over the dictator. He was with the dictator up to the very last minute, when he was actually flying out of Tunisia. Only then did the White House take any position that\u2019s slightly positive. Same with Mubarak, the dictator of Egypt. With Israeli influence, the US kept supporting Mubarak up to really the very last minute, when they saw that he\u2019s crumbling, his regime is crumbling. And only then they started to speak a bit positively about the Egyptian popular revolution. So the fact is, no thanks to any US role in any of these Arab revolutions\u2013in fact, if anything, the US has played a very negative role. So the best thing that President Obama can do for the region is just leave us alone. We can build democracy on our own. We\u2019ve seen how you, the US administration, builds democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan. No, thank you. That\u2019s not the kind of democracy we need.\nJAY: In his speech, President Obama spoke about the reconciliation agreement between Hamas and Fatah. Here\u2019s a clip of that.\nOBAMA: And particularly, the recent announcement of an agreement between Fatah and Hamas raises profound and legitimate questions for Israel. How can one negotiate with a party that has shown itself unwilling to recognize your right to exist? And in the weeks and months to come, Palestinian leaders will have to provide a credible answer to that question.\nJAY: So President Obama seems to be saying something that\u2019s certainly quite different than Netanyahu\u2019s saying, which is that Hamas possibly could be included in these negotiations, something that Netanyahu\u2019s made very clear is absolute no to them. Obama says they\u2019re going to have to answer these questions about Hamas\u2019s unwillingness to recognize Israel. But it\u2019s not the kind of language, certainly, you would have heard perhaps from a President Bush that simply would have called Hamas terrorist. So does this reflect a different position, then, by the US from Israel?\nBARGHOUTI: Well, in your question, you\u2019re assuming that the US position is identical to Israel\u2019s. And that\u2019s in fact true, and that is the problem. Instead of talking what Hamas and Fatah should answer to Israel, he never mentions that while Hamas does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist as a Jewish state\u2013and that\u2019s the key, and I\u2019ll talk about that later\u2013Israel is wiping out our existence in reality, concretely, on the ground. Forget about verbal recognition. Israel does not just not recognize our right to exist; it is actually disappearing us as we speak. As President Obama is speaking, Israel is ethnically cleansing more and more Palestinians, building more colonies on occupied territories, and denying our refugees the right to return, and carrying on with its apartheid policies in Israel, passing more and more racist laws. So they\u2019re disappearing the Palestinians as President Obama is so concerned about a verbal recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist. Having said that, what does that sentence mean? President Obama again reiterated his new position, which was not the position of Clinton, say, or even presidents before then, that Israel should be a Jewish state, and he repeated that and said a state of the Jewish people. Is he willing to say that the US is a state of the Christian people? What would people feel if President Obama had said that? What does it mean for Palestinians who\u2019ve been ethnically cleansed from today\u2019s Israel and Palestinians who today live in Israel with Israeli citizenship, when somebody, a president of another country that\u2019s a partner in Israeli crimes, says that your country shall not be yours, it will be the state of the Jewish people? He\u2019s reducing us not just to second-class citizens; he\u2019s reducing us to nonexistent citizens. If the US were a state of the Christian people, Jews in the US, Muslims, Hindus, atheists would have no room in that state. A state based on equal rights for all should not agree that any other state has a right, a divine right, to be an ethnocentric state, a racist, exclusivist state.\nJAY: So this speech was billed as being directed at least partly towards the Arab peoples, the Palestinian people, and to show that the American state is on the side of this Arab Spring, Arab uprising. Will it resonate in that way with the Arab people?\nBARGHOUTI: A very negative resonance, I suspect. He fell into all the traps that people expected him to, coming across as the most biased president to Israel\u2019s interests so far, the most biased US president so far, maybe after Bush junior, coming across as offering some bribes to the Egyptian revolution\u2013I\u2019ll wipe out $1 billion in debts and I\u2019ll give you another $1 billion. Well, you were privy to the fact that the dictator Mubarak was stealing billions and billions, some say tens of billions of dollars, most of it invested in the US for 30 years, and you had nothing to say about that. And now you\u2019re offering the Egyptian revolution $1 billion and some entrepreneur\u2019s support system in Congress. I mean, really, what does President Obama think of the Arab people, regardless of his rhetoric?\nJAY: To be fair, there was one statement in his speech that said that the United States would assist in recovering stolen assets. One assumes he meant Mubarak. I guess now we\u2019ll see how real that is.\nBARGHOUTI: But, I mean, he misses the point about the Arab revolutions. It\u2019s not just about a vendor who lost his dignity. It\u2019s about people asking for social justice. And this is the term that he ignored completely. It\u2019s about democracy, freedom, and social justice. Social justice, by definition, means that US and Western pillage, the exploitation of the resources of the region, have to come to an end. We have to rise as economic powers. Egypt has to rise as an economic power based on its own resources and its own people\u2019s capacities, not upon US dictates, not benefiting Google, Intel, and Northrup Grumman, but benefiting Egyptian people, Egyptian companies, and so on. So trying to bribe the current Egyptian leadership, which is not yet elected leadership, with a couple of billion dollars is really too little too late and missing the point completely about the Egyptian revolution.\nJAY: Thanks very much for joining us, Omar.",
        "The antics of luminescent deep-sea creatures are being observed for the first time without the cacophony of lights and noise which usually accompanies such research, report US scientists.\nA smart new camera, designed to operate in the dark without being noticed by the creatures it is observing, is being trialed this week in California's Monterey Bay by Dr Edith Widder and colleagues of the Harbour Branch Oceanographic Institution in Florida. The team also plans to use the camera with a lure consisting of an electronic jellyfish which mimics the various bioluminescent light patterns given off by its real counterpart.\n\"We are hoping to do some honest to goodness unobtrusive observation, which really hasn't happened in the ocean,\" said Widder. \"Ultimately the goal is to see animals or behaviours nobody has ever seen before.\"\nAlthough the deep sea makes up about 78% of the planet's inhabitable volume, little is known about most of its inhabitants - more than half of which are capable of making their own light, or bioluminescence. This is in part because traditional research methods, such as deep-towed nets, can damage animals making their natural behaviours impossible to observe in the lab. Vehicles can deliver humans deep down, but typically ther lights, motors and electric fields scare animals away or frighten them into unnatural behaviour.\nIt was for these reasons Widder helped create the new unobtrusive camera system called the \"Eye in the Sea\". The system operates automatically on the seafloor and is designed to be unnoticed by animals. When the system detects animals nearby giving off bioluminescent light, this triggers a video camera to record the light being produced. A red light - which is out of the animals' normal vision range - is then turned on to take illuminated footage. The system can also be programmed to film surrounding areas at regular intervals, for instance when it is set up with bait to attract animals.\nWidder also wants to trial an electronic device designed to mimic the various bioluminescent light patterns given off by the Atolla jellyfish (pictured). The artificial jellyfish lure has a ring of blue LED lights around its outer edge that can be programmed to light up in patterns similar to those created by the real Atolla.\nWhen threatened the jellyfish sometimes respond by creating a moving circular wave of light around their outer edge which is referred to as a \"burglar alarm\" response. Scientists theorise that jellyfish use this response to attract large animals in to eat jellyfish predators. Widder wants to use the lure, camera and a box of bait to test this and other hypotheses about how and why animals such as jellyfish use their bioluminescent light. She also wants to use the jellyfish lure to attract large predators to the area, which would be captured on film.",
        "CLEVELAND | Mo Williams knows the pain and frustration Cleveland fans have been feeling since LeBron James left town six months ago.\nThat\u2019s one reason why Williams is looking forward to Thursday night, when James makes his long-awaited return to Cleveland as a member of the Miami Heat. The Cavaliers guard understands why fans around the region still feel betrayed about James\u2018 departure after playing in Cleveland for seven years.\nThe schedule says the Cavaliers will play their 18th game of the season, but Williams isn\u2019t kidding anyone. This will be no normal game. This will be no walk in the park.\nWilliams says he and the Cavaliers are excited about the opportunity to face their former teammate, who led the franchise to the NBA Finals in 2007 and to the league\u2019s best record the last two seasons.\nWilliams, acquired from Milwaukee prior to the 2008-09 season, was more troubled by James\u2018 decision to leave that any player still on the team. He was quoted in a story during the summer that he considered retirement, comments which he backtracked on at the team\u2019s media day.\nWilliams and James had a chance meeting after \u201cThe Decision\u201d in which they cleared the air. Williams said they have not spoken since.\nIf any Cleveland players feel resentment toward James, they\u2019re keeping it to themselves.\nGibson came to Cleveland as a 20-year-old rookie out of the University of Texas in 2006. He said he and James still keep in touch.\nWhile the subject of whether James misses Cleveland hasn\u2019t come up in their conversations, Gibson believes that is indeed the case.\nWilliams expects James will be booed and heckled, but hopes the fans\u2019 reaction doesn\u2019t go beyond that.\nByron Scott accepted the Cavaliers\u2019 coaching job before James departed.\nScott has been in the league for more than 25 years as a player, assistant and head coach. He can\u2019t recall one player generating the negative reaction from one city as James has received in Cleveland.\nScott was jokingly asked if the Cavaliers might look past the Heat in anticipation of Saturday night\u2019s game with Minnesota.",
        "Most of the 32 artists, all with some connection to Maine, have never participated in the show before.\nAlison Ferris had two goals when she chose artists for the Portland Museum of Art biennial: She wanted to include artists who had never participated, and she wanted the work to represent a variety of media.\nIn the end, she chose 32 artists with connections to Maine, of whom only three have shown in the every-other-year survey of contemporary art. And for the first time, the biennial will include Maine Indian basketmakers.\nThe museum announced its selection of artists this week. They range from George Neptune, a 26-year-old Passamaquoddy Indian who makes baskets, to Emily Nelligan, an artist in her 90s best known for her drawings from Great Cranberry Island.\nThe exhibition, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Get There from Here: The 2015 Portland Museum of Art Biennial,\u201d opens Oct. 8.\nFerris, who lives in Edgecomb, is curator of Kohler Art Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and past curator at Bowdoin College Museum of Art in Brunswick. She also worked as assistant director of the Maine Arts Commission for a short time.\nThe every-other-year exhibition offers a survey of contemporary art by artists with connections to Maine. In the past, artists have been chosen by a panel of independent judges hired by the museum to evaluate the work.\nTwo years ago, the museum\u2019s chief curator, Jessica May, who was new on the job at the time, curated the exhibition as a way to familiarize herself with the state and its artists. She asked Ferris to handle the task this time because she respects Ferris\u2019 work and appreciates her depth of knowledge of contemporary art. \u201cShe\u2019s an independent curator who has one foot in Maine and one in the larger contemporary art world,\u201d May said.\nThe three artists who have shown in a previous PMA biennial are Brett Bigbee of South Portland, John Bisbee of Brunswick and Thomas Brennan of Vermont.\nAmong the newcomers are four basketmakers: Theresa Secord of Waterville and Sarah Sockbeson of Kingfield, who are Penobscot basketmakers; and Jeremy Frey of Indian Island and Neptune of Bar Harbor, who are Passamaquoddy. Secord and Frey are recognized nationally for their work, while Neptune and Sockbeson are young artists learning the traditional ways.\nArtists expressed pleasure at being curated into the exhibition.\nRandy Regier, formerly of Portland now of Wichita, Kansas, will show one of his large-scale, toy-like sculptures. He started designing and building them when he worked in Portland. His career has evolved since moving to Kansas a few years ago. He called it \u201ca poignant moment\u201d to have his work \u201ccalled back to Maine. I have mixed emotions, but they\u2019re all positive,\u201d he said.",
        "It was a hard, cold spring rain. My husband, Lenny, and I had been walking on the Appalachian Trail since 8 that morning. When we finally got to the shelter as it was getting dark, we saw that someone had hung a tarp to prevent rain from getting in. Inside, an old man was sitting and cooking, his gear spread out to dry.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have company.\u201d He grumbled.\n\u201cThis shelter is for eight people, so could you please move your stuff?\u201d No answer; he just kept stirring his pot.\nI was about to push his things aside to make room for our sleeping bags when Lenny\u2019s cooler head prevailed. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he said. We had to walk another two miles before we found ground flat enough for our tent.\nBut if this old man and I had had guns, we could have settled the matter pretty quickly.\nHere in Western North Carolina, we\u2019re blessed with four National Park Service units: the Smokies, the Blue Ridge Parkway, the A.T. and the Carl Sandburg Home. Many hikers and park officials in the region say they\u2019re leery of a proposal to allow loaded guns in national parks. Congress, however, is considering lifting the ban on loaded, operable weapons in national parks and wildlife refuges. Labeled \u201cA bill to protect innocent Americans from violent crime in national parks,\u201d it basically says that ready-to-fire weapons will be allowed in national parks if they\u2019re allowed in the state the park is in (S. 2619 and H.R. 5434). And that holds true for North Carolina.\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if the bill\u2019s sponsors\u2014Sen. Thomas Coburn, R-Okla., and Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas\u2014and its supporters have ever slept in a national park, particularly as adults. When you stay in a backcountry shelter in the Smokies or along the A.T., you sleep cheek to jowl; the only personal space is the width of your sleeping bag. One person snores, another rustles plastic bags all night, and there\u2019s always someone who comes in late, finds there\u2019s no room and puts up his tent, dropping poles and cursing under his breath. The togetherness is wonderful; by morning you\u2019ve become family. Guns will tear that apart and make it risky to have a disagreement.\nSo what do those who actually camp and backpack in our national parks think of the idea?\nJim Parham, co-owner of Milestone Press near Bryson City, frequently backpacks in the Smokies with his son. \u201cAnyone who wants to take a gun in the park already does, so this will legalize these people,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut it\u2019s nuts that they want to do this. It\u2019s a total overreaction to a once-in-a-blue-moon event.\u201d Jim is referring to the recent murders in several national forests, including Pisgah, committed by a drifter\u2014not with a gun but by physically overpowering his victims.\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park lies in two states and spans several counties. Cataloochee Valley is in Haywood County, Fontana Lake is in Swain, and Ramsey Cascades is outside Gatlinburg, Tenn. Is the gun-carrying visitor going to check out each county\u2019s regulation?\nBesides, we\u2019re talking about national parks: They shouldn\u2019t be subject to state regulations. These parks were created to preserve outstanding areas, and they\u2019re not the same as national forests. Where will it stop? Hunting? Dogs on the trail? Logging? Call me paranoid, but is this a step toward turning parks into forests? I\u2019m not against hunting and carrying rifles in forests. Bears, deer, crows and squirrels, you can shoot them all\u2014in season. There\u2019s a possum in my neighborhood you could help me with. But you can\u2019t hunt in the Smokies.\n\u201cGuns don\u2019t get you out of trouble\u2014guns get you into trouble,\u201d declares Dan Rogers, the director of Camp Daniel Boone and the author of America One Step at a Time (Thirsty Turtle Press, 2003). And Gary Eblen, community-outreach director for Diamond Brand Outdoors in Arden, sees the proposed law as an overreaction to an isolated incident.\nThere will always be \u201cbad guys\u201d carrying loaded weapons. What I\u2019m worried about is a good guy who loses his temper over space in a campground, a barking dog, or loud music after 10 p.m. Is he going to use his voice, his fists, a knife or a gun?",
        "IAC-backed Aereo is expanding its disruptive pay TV service into 22 new markets, it announced today.\nAereo lets you watch free, locally broadcast HDTV channels (from local affiliate stations for ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CW, and others) on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. Aereo uses a tiny HD antenna the size of a dime to pick up the broadcast signal for each of its users, which for now allows it to operate legally. Aereo also provides a DVR feature that lets you record up to 40 hours of content.\nPreviously, Aereo was only available to residents of New York City, but soon it will be available in several cities across the country, including Boston, Miami, Austin, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Washington DC, Baltimore, Detroit, Denver, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Tampa, Cleveland, Kansas City, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City, Birmingham (Ala.), Providence (R.I.), and Madison (Wis.).\nThe expansion will start this spring in the warmer cities and continue through the end of 2013. (The company said it\u2019ll take nearly two months to get the service up and running for beta testing.) These cities represent the first phase of growth for the service, which will eventually roll out in more areas across the country.\nInitially, Aereo will offer access through a beta version of the service, which you can sign up for today on its website. (The company estimates that it\u2019ll grant access to about 1,000 subscribers for the beta.) And like the NYC service, Aereo will offer a flexible pricing model that allows you to pay $1 per day, $8 per month, or $80 per year.\nAt the 2013 CES, Aereo also announced that it closed a new $38 million round today, led by existing investors IAC and Highland Capital Partners, with participation from FirstMark Capital, First Round Capital, High Line Venture Partners, and other previous investors. The additional capital will help pay for the cost of expansion.\nPresumably, the new funding will also help pay for legal expenses related to ongoing copyright infringement claims from major U.S entertainment companies that fear Aereo will disrupt the traditional \u201cpay TV\u201d business model.\nFederal judges denied an earlier claim by 17 media companies to stop Aereo\u2019s service until a final decision can be made on whether or not the company\u2019s method of using tiny antennas to stream broadcast channels is legal. Aereo CEO Chet Kanojia told VentureBeat in a phone interview that it is confident that a final court decision will be in its favor, which is evident since it\u2019s moving forward with its expansion plans.\nMedia companies, many of which are cable TV service providers as well, are concerned that Aereo\u2019s lower pricing and prime-time programming will steal business away from them. Further more, Aereo is also pursuing deals to bring a handful of cable networks to its service. Last month, Aereo reached a deal to bring the Bloomberg business network to its subscribers, a deal that will extend when it launches in other cities later this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very closely with a few people to bring more channels (to Aereo),\u201d Kanojia told VentureBeat, adding that we could hear an announcement about a new channel agreement midway through 2013. Yet, the company\u2019s main focus right now is in launching and promoting the service in other cities, he said.\n\u201cThis is a build year for us. and our main concern is in introducing people in these new markets to Aereo, and showing them (its) value,\u201d Kanojia said.",
        "AUSTIN \u2014 Rep. Rafael Anchia filed a resolution Monday condemning President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel to the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.\nAnchia, a Democrat from Dallas, described the move as \"unconstitutional, un-American, unwise and unorganized.\"\n\"This was not well thought out,\" Anchia said. \"It was developed without consultation of the folks that are supposed to keep us safe, and the president really messed this up, and he needs to pull it down. The Legislature of the state of Texas needs to demand that he do so.\"\nTrump's order bans Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely and creates a 90-day travel ban for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump also suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days.\nAnchia's resolution calls the move \"an open act of discrimination against Muslims\" and says the Texas House stands by \"our moral oaths to respect the rule of law and love our neighbors.\"\nA federal judge issued a temporary stay Saturday that prevented the government from deporting people under the ban, but the judge's order did not apply to people traveling to the United States. A number of travelers were detained at airports across the country on Saturday.\nTrump denies that his executive order is a Muslim ban and said Sunday that the country \"will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression.\"\nAnchia said Trump's intent behind the order is clear, regardless of what he says publicly.\n\"It means nothing to me because during the campaign he promised that he was going to ban Muslims,\" Anchia said. \"While he is not banning every Muslim in the world, the effect of this ban falls almost exclusively on Muslims.\n\"It sends absolutely the wrong signal to the rest of the world about who we are as Americans,\" Anchia continued. \"This sends a signal that Muslims are not welcome in the American family, and that's just wrong.\"\nAnchia said he hopes to see Gov. Greg Abbott address the ban during his State of the State address Tuesday, during which Abbott will outline his legislative priorities for the session.\n\"We really do need the governor to speak up for the people of this state, whether it's on a border wall or a 20 percent tax on bilateral trade with our number one trading partner or a Muslim ban,\" he said. \"We're really going to be listening for Governor Abbott's leadership on all of these issues.\"\nDallas Rep. Eric Johnson on Monday sent a letter to Abbott, asking him to denounce Trump's order. Johnson said the move was \"an abuse of power and constitutes a most reckless immigration policy.\"\n\"This ill-advised executive order may actually make Americans less safe by fueling dangerous xenophobic sentiments at home and feeding into the propaganda of radical terrorist groups abroad,\" Johnson wrote. \"As a fellow Christian, American, and Texan, I urge you to denounce this order during your State of the State address tomorrow.\"\nState Sen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas, said Monday that he strongly supports Trump's order because it \"will keep Texans safe.\" He also criticized protesters who flooded airports in Texas and across the country over the weekend.\n\"I am deeply disappointed in the unhinged emotionalism that has governed some Americans' responses to the president's order,\" Huffines said in a prepared statement. \"While the implementation of the order was flawed, the principles and ideas within it remain sound, particularly as they relate to keeping Texans safe from poorly screened refugees who might unleash terror against us and our families.\"\nAnchia said he flew into DFW International Airport on Saturday and visited the terminal where protesters were chanting and waving signs. He said he \"got very emotional\" when he saw what was happening.\n\"I saw them as protesters against the policy, but also as great ambassadors for America,\" Anchia said. \"So when people were coming out ... they were being hugged, they were being affirmed and they were being welcomed into the American family. And that's really who we are.\"\nThe Texas Capitol is inviting Muslims from across the state to Austin for Muslim Capitol Day on Tuesday. In 2015, the event drew protesters who told participants to \"Go home!\" Anchia said it's vital that lawmakers show visitors they are welcome, adding that on Tuesday, \"We all need to be Muslims.\"",

        "Medicaid expansion in Michigan has paid off handsomely for most of the state's 14 Medicaid HMOs.\nThe three biggest Medicaid HMOs in Michigan \u2014 for-profits Meridian Health Plan of Michigan, Molina Healthcare of Michigan and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan \u2014 increased underwriting income to record levels, despite experiencing double-digit average increases in medical expense costs and a bump in administrative expenses, according to an analysis of Michigan financial data by Minneapolis-based consultant Allan Baumgarten.\nMolina Healthcare recorded $82 million in underwriting income last year for a 6.7 percent margin, and Meridian notched $27 million in underwriting income for a 1.3 percent margin, according to financial data filed to the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services.\nMolina of Michigan is owned by Molina Healthcare of Long Beach, Calif., which operates Medicaid plans in 11 states, including Illinois and Ohio. Meridian is a family-owned plan based in Detroit that runs Medicaid and Medicare plans in six states.\nUnitedHealthcare Community recorded $79.1 million in underwriting income, a 65 percent increase from $47.9 million in 2014. The Southfield-based plan, which is owned by the nation's largest HMO, Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealthcare Group Inc., lost $8.7 million in 2013, the year before Healthy Michigan Medicaid expansion began in April 2014.\nPriority Health Choice, a nonprofit plan owned by Grand Rapids-based Spectrum Health System, also found positive income during the Healthy Michigan expansion. Medicaid underwriting income jumped to $13 million, a 2.9 percent margin, bouncing back from losses of $1.2 million in 2013 and $1.3 million in 2014.\nEven Harbor Health Plan Inc., the smallest Medicaid plan with 6,600 members, turned around its operation, recording $8.5 million in underwriting income on Medicaid in 2015 for a 24 percent profit margin.\nThe for-profit plan, which is owned by Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp., lost $41,000 in 2013 when Tenet acquired the former ProCare Health Plan. Tenet also owns Detroit Medical Center.\nHarbor Health CEO Mehrdad Shafa, M.D., said in a statement that the HMO financially improved for several reasons, including early medical intervention, outreach efforts to promote healthy lifestyles and the expansion of the Medicaid program.\nChristine Surdock: \"There was a pent-up demand.\"\nMeridian, the state's largest Medicaid HMO with 455,000 members in 2015, has enjoyed a good two-year growth run, moving into new headquarters in downtown Detroit and adding more than 1,000 new employees.\nThe HMO also increased its underwriting income 315 percent to $27 million last year from $6.5 million in 2013. Underwriting margins rose to 1.3 percent last year from 1 percent in 2014 and 0.6 percent in 2013.\nBut in 2015, underwriting income rose more slowly to $14.3 million because medical expenses started to rise more quickly than the previous year, Meridian COO Jon Cotton said.\n\"It is definitely better (income) than we expected,\" said Cotton, noting that the premium rates have been fair the past two years.\nLike all HMOs, Meridian's medical expenses increased the past two years \u2014 13 percent to $321 per member per month last year from $283 in 2014.\n\"(Healthy Michigan) population never had insurance ...,\" Cotton said. \"We had no idea what their medical costs and needs would be.\"\nCotton said the increase in medical expenses not only reflected costs associated from a somewhat sicker Healthy Michigan population, but also from other populations many of the plans absorbed during the past several years.\nAside from the 142,000 Healthy Michigan members, Meridian added nearly 50,000 members that included TANF, or temporary assistance for needy families, which are mostly single moms with babies; aged, blind and patients with disabilities, known as ABD; and children with essential health needs, Cotton said.\nBut Cotton said once Meridian started adding thousands of Healthy Michigan members and the health risk assessment tests started coming back, \"we saw much more prevalence of chronic conditions \u2014 diabetes, heart disease, asthma and behavioral health issues \u2014 than we expected.\"\nHowever, \"once the costs came in it was much lower than we thought \u2026 , Cotton said. \"It makes a big difference if someone has diabetes and you get them under control, on insulin, they never had before.\"\nOne reason costs may have risen more quickly at Meridian, said Cotton, is that it uses a variety of software programs that measure future medical needs of its population.\n\"We use predictive modeling on each patient and try to get them services to prevent them from developing into a more severe case,\" Cotton said. \"It probably costs more up front, but we avoid costs using these predictive tools,\" he said.\nMeridian is one of at least five HMOs \u2014 including Molina \u2014 that will be required to repay the state for overpayments it received based on \"risk-corridor\" provisions in the Medicaid contract.\nCotton said the plan will write a check to the state for $3.6 million because its patients were less sick and less expensive than predicted from April 2014 to April 2015.\nMolina, which is the second-largest Medicaid HMO with 327,000 members, also is on the hook to repay the state about $8.5 million under the risk corridor contracts.\nDespite Molina's medical expenses increasing 23 percent to $312 per member per month in 2015 from $254 per member per month in 2013, Molina was able to increase its Medicaid underwriting income 222 percent to $81.9 million in 2015 from $25.4 million in 2013.\n\"Molina has a very strong clinical program, and we certainly are dedicated toward taking care of this population,\" said Christine Surdock, Molina Michigan's CEO.\nShe said profit margins have fluctuated over the years. \"Any success we might have right now is (targeted toward) improving quality and cost effectiveness,\" Surdock said.\nWhile the Healthy Michigan population required more medical services than traditional Medicaid, Surdock said use was lower than projected, especially in 2015.\n\"There was pent-up demand. We tried to get those members to see their physician as opposed to the ER,\" she said.\nAt Priority Health, medical expenses for the Medicaid population rose 15 percent, lower than the industry trend of 20 percent, to $295 per member per month in 2015 from $257 in 2013.\n\"We did anticipate that the Healthy Michigan population would be higher cost and higher utilization\" because they are adults and not mothers and children, said Guy Gauthier, Priority's senior director of government programs. \"We were pretty conservative in how we recorded operations during first year, even into 2015.\"\nHarbor Health's Shafa said Healthy Michigan patients sometimes require complex treatment because their previous lack of access to affordable care created bigger problems.\n\"As we are able to address the underlying problem, ongoing care and health often becomes less expensive to maintain,\" Shafa said. \"As more people have access to health care, we also expect to see an improvement in general health, and a move toward enhanced population health.\"",
        "B OFFENSIVE LINE: The running lanes weren\u2019t as wide as they were against New Orleans, but the absence of Cam Newton played a big part in that. Anderson was sacked three times, but one came on a scramble when he was stopped for no gain. Continuity is helping the front five gain confidence each week.\nA DEFENSIVE LINE: Ends Charles Johnson and Mario Addison changed the course of the game when they combined for a sack of Josh McCown on the Bucs\u2019 first possession of the second half. Addison\u2019s strip of McCown was recovered by defensive tackle Kawann Short and gave the Panthers the ball at the Tampa Bay 4. Johnson has turned up his game the past few weeks.\nC LINEBACKERS: Luke Kuechly (six tackles) and Thomas Davis (four) finished with season lows in tackles, although Kuechly ended Tampa Bay\u2019s comeback hopes with an interception. Both were sealed off on Doug Martin\u2019s 63-yard run on the Bucs\u2019 second offensive snap. Davis hyperextended his left knee in the second half \u2013 not the knee that has undergone three ACL surgeries.\nB DEFENSIVE BACKS: Cornerback Josh Norman was upset about giving up Mike Evans\u2019 8-yard touchdown catch in the first half. Norman was in good position, but the 6-foot-6 Evans went up over him to make the catch. Rookie safety Tre Boston tied Kuechly for the team high with six tackles, and veteran safety Roman Harper had a sack and strip of McCown, credited after a call was reversed on replay review.\nC SPECIAL TEAMS: Graham Gano was 4-of-5 on field goals, with his only miss coming from 50 yards. Gano had touchbacks on five of his six kickoffs. Brenton Bersin fielded punts cleanly and had a career-long, 18-yard return. Fozzy Whittaker averaged 19.7 yards on three kickoff returns.\nB COACHING: Defensive coordinator Sean McDermott\u2019s decision to turn up the pressure on McCown in the second half changed momentum and field position. Offensive coordinator Mike Shula had a good plan against the Bucs\u2019 Tampa 2 zone, exploiting the middle of the field with Olsen and Benjamin. Ron Rivera\u2019s commitment to several young players after the bye week has resulted in an injection of speed and energy on both sides of the ball.",

        "\"If wishes were horses, beggars might ride.\" A Texas judge and a urologist ventured into uncharted territory recently when they agreed to harvesting sperm from a dead man.\n\"If wishes were horses, beggars might ride.\"\nA Texas judge and a urologist ventured into uncharted territory recently when they agreed to harvesting sperm from a dead man.\nIt wasn't Nikolas Evans' bereaved widow who asked for the sperm. Evans was not married. His mother, Missy Evans, pleaded with a Travis County probate judge because, she said, her 21-year-old son once said he wanted children. Three sons, in fact.\nWell, plenty of us would like to keep getting money from the tooth fairy, but real life typically intervenes when we grow up. Nikolas, 21, was punched in a street fight in Austin on March 27 and fell to the ground, striking his head. He died April 5. His death is a shame, but it's also a fact. Collecting his sperm won't bring him back, but it opens up a Pandora's box of ethical and practical questions.\nSomehow Missy Evans convinced the judge to order the county Medical Examiner's Office to keep Nikolas' body properly chilled and to allow an expert to remove the sperm, then found a urologist to collect it. She's been told much of the sperm is viable.\nSo ... the prospective father is dead. Who knows whether, even given his wish one day to be a parent, he would authorize his mother to create a child of his, to be born after he's dead? Who will be the \"mother\"? Would Nikolas approve of his mother's choice? What rights would the biological mother have? Would she and her \"mother-in-law\" see eye to eye on prenatal care during the pregnancy? On child-rearing? Most important, what would this innocent child think when old enough to learn of his or her origins?\nWith all respect and sympathy for Missy Evans, this appears to be a classic case of attempting to replace a lost child. Here's hoping that future medical and legal professionals and prospective \"mothers\" see the myriad pitfalls that lie ahead in this fraught scenario and decline to be a part of it.",
        "The Queensland Government has known for more than two years that the site where it proposes to dump millions of tonnes of dredge spoil at Abbot Point was the worst of seven possible options for port expansion from an environmental point of view.\nExperts working for North Queensland Bulk Ports, a government-owned corporation which operates the Abbot Point terminal, reported in September 2012 that the site west of the port where the State Government now proposes to dump the spoils offered the lowest cost option for reclamation and expansion and was nearest to the coast.\nBut the consultants warned: \"However, the West Site is considered the least desirable from an environmental and approvals perspective as it will result in the greatest impact on the Caley Valley Wetland and Cultural Heritage values of Abbot Point\".\nThe reports, not previously made public and obtained under Right To Information, show experts considered the risks of expansion on the western site were so high it was in any case highly unlikely it would obtain Commonwealth approval.\nEngineers Aurecon reported in September 2012 under the heading of \"Approval Risk\": \"Approval and potential delay risk high due to loss of wetland area and resulting impacts to wetland species [migratory birds etc].\"\nAnd environmental experts E3 Consult warned of \"intense scrutiny from community and environmental groups\" of such a plan and predicted: \"The likelihood of not gaining an approval is very high. Should an approval be granted by the Commonwealth Minister, it is highly likely to be appealed, which could delay the commencement of the project.\"\nFederal Environment Minister Greg Hunt is considering whether to approve a State Government plan to dump about 3 million cubic metres of dredge spoils west of the port as an alternative to a controversial plan to dispose of it at sea on the Great Barrier Reef.\nIn October, Mr Hunt agreed to a Queensland Government request to assess the project on \"preliminary documentation\", which streamlines the process.\nPremier Campbell Newman's Government reportedly wants to begin preparatory excavation work as early as New Year's Day.\nThe Caley Valley is a nationally recognised wetland and provides habitat for hundreds of species of birds, some migrating from as far away as the Arctic Circle.\nThe Newman Government has told the ABC about 150 hectares, or 2.5 per cent of the total area of the wetland, would be affected by the dredge spoil dumping plan.\nEnvironmentalists and the state Opposition have criticised the plan as rushed, warning that not enough is known about how the wetland will react to the development.\nThe Newman Government is keen to improve coal-handling facilities to kick-start the mining of coal reserves in the Galilee Basin inland of the port, where Indian mining giant Adani has proposed building one of the world's biggest coal mines.\n\"It's kind of an insane idea of really trying to satisfy the pressure from Adani to get this development going as quickly as possible because they've threatened to withdraw from the development if they're not dredging by 2015,\" Jeremy Tager, of the Far North Queensland Conservation Council, told the ABC.\nThe office of State Development Minister Jeff Seeney told the ABC that the dumping of dredge spoil on part of the wetlands was expected to result in \"impact, both direct and indirect, to migratory birds and the Australian Painted Snipe\".\nBut Mr Seeney said the plan included an offset of 1,400 hectares, many times more than the wetland area affected by the dredge spoil dumping.\n\"We will offset that with huge enhancement of the existing wetland,\" Mr Seeney said.\nIf there are other options that are less environmentally impactful, why is the Government taking the quickest option?\n\"We're using the dredge spoil as a positive, to enhance an area of port land.\"\nMr Seeney said avoiding dumping spoil on the Great Barrier Reef was \"the best outcome\" of the plan.\n\"Even though the permits were issued for [dumping on the reef], it was an emotive issue that people were not prepared to accept. So we've solved that,\" he said.\nUNESCO has repeatedly threatened to list the Great Barrier Reef as endangered, raising concerns about the potential impact on tourism.\nOpposition environment spokeswoman Jackie Trad said she would be surprised if the Commonwealth approved the plan.\n\"UNESCO is watching,\" she said.\n\"The independent experts have said there are other ways to expand the port. If there are other options that are less environmentally impactful, why is the Government taking the quickest option?\n\"What the Government has chosen is port expansion for one coal company, not a port expansion for the health of the region.\"",
        "Consumers will pay the highest Fourth of July gasoline prices in six years, but pump prices would be far higher if not for dramatic changes in the U.S. oil industry.\nBoth the production and refining sides of the industry are contributing to a better supply environment, thanks to the oil shale boom and significant expansion of the U.S. refining industry in the last several years.\nPrices are expected to go lower this summer, and by Labor Day could be 7 cents to 12 cents cheaper per gallon than the current national average of $3.67 per gallon.\n\"Without hurricanes, I would say Labor Day, I would be looking at something in the $3.55 to $3.60 neighborhood. I think the real decline always occurs in the last 100 days of the year,\" said Tom Kloza, oil analyst with GasBuddy.com.\nU.S. refining capacity\u201417.9 million barrels\u2014is at the highest level it's been in 33 years, when it was briefly more than 18 million barrels. For a nation that was once concerned about a lack of new refineries, the industry has been expanding existing facilities, adding more than 2 million barrels a day capacity since the late 1990s.\n\"It's the highest since 1981. That says to me rather than building new refineries, we've just expanded existing ones to get the economies of scale,\" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. \"In 1981 there were 341 refineries.\" Now, there are 142.\n\"A lot of 1981's capacity was not complex, or sophisticated. Back in 1981, we weren't exporting about 1.5 million barrels a day of diesel and gasoline,\" said Kloza.\nThe U.S. exports, which go to Europe and South America, are near record levels, but they could increase. \"The refining capacity number may go up in the next couple of years. There are a lot of studies that say if we don't lift the export ban on crude, we build another half a million barrels a day or even a million barrels a day of refining capacity in the U.S., and we'll become more of an export nation because our crude prices and natural gas prices are cheaper than everybody else. It's a slight edge, but it's an edge,\" Kloza said.\nGasoline prices typically decline between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, but this year prices rose, as the Iraq situation drove up crude oil prices, Kloza said.\nRefinery utilization is also rising as the industry brings more capacity back online, some of which was offline due to routine maintenance. Refining utilization rose to 91.4 percent, and gasoline stockpiles fell by 1.2 million barrels, in the week ended June 27, according to the Energy Information Administration.\nAccording to Platt's, a large crude oil unit at Phillips 66's plant in Montana is adding 58,000 barrels a day after going offline due to a fire June 11.\nExxon Mobil restarted a unit June 12 at its 200,700 barrel-per-day refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana, after maintenance, and Exxon also returned its Beaumont, Texas, refinery to normal operations last week after planned work, according to Platt's.\n\"They're storming back, and the industry is running at almost 90 percent,\" said oil analyst John Kilduff of Again Capital.\nU.S. oil production has grown to about 8.6 million barrels a day recently, more than a million barrels a day greater than last year.\n\"We're on track to become the world's largest oil producer, which is incredible,\" said Kilduff.\nThe U.S. production has displaced West African light sweet crude that was being shipped to East Coast and Gulf Coast refineries. That oil is now coming from the Bakken in North Dakota and elsewhere. Oil from Canada is feeding Gulf Coast and California refineries.\nAs more North American oil is being used, the price difference between the international benchmark Brent and West Texas Intermediate and other U.S. grades is shrinking. However, that spread widened when Syrian militants seized parts of Iraq. But the differential narrowed again when the U.S. allowed the export of condensates, a minimally processed, lightweight petroleum byproduct.\nOil has been drifting lower, WTI was trading at $104.89 per barrel early Wednesday, while Brent was trading in New York at $111.55 per barrel. Brent weakened Wednesday on a possible return of Libyan oil exports after rebels said they could open two oil terminals.\n\"I think as long as the Iraq situation holds, I believe they're (gasoline prices) going down, potentially significantly,\" said Kilduff.\nKloza said the U.S. production is offsetting some geopolitical pressure on prices. \"If we didn't have the domestic shale oil boom, right now the noise from Iraq and the problems with Libya, Sudan, Nigeria, we'd be paying regularly over $4 as a nationwide average,\" said Kloza.\nLipow said the U.S. refining industry is in good shape, and has a good future. \"We're exporting more, and we're processing more crude, and U.S. demand has declined since 2007,\" said Lipow. Gasoline demand has been dropping as more fuel-efficient cars replace aging vehicles, and cars will continue to get more efficient.\n\"We're in better shape versus the rest of the world than we have been in 20, 30 years,\" he said.\n\"Even though we haven't built refineries, we continue to do small expansions on existing facilities. As we go forward, refiners such as Valero, Tesoro and Marathon have projects underway to increase refining capacity.\"",
        "Gaza is a coastal strip of land that lay on ancient trading and maritime routes along the Mediterranean shore.\nHeld by the Ottoman Empire until 1917, it passed from British to Egyptian to Israeli military rule over the last century and is now a fenced-in enclave inhabited by two million Palestinians.\nTens of thousands of Palestinians took refuge in Gaza after fleeing or being driven from their homes. The invading Egyptian army had seized a narrow coastal strip 25 miles (40 km) long from the Sinai to just south of Ashkelon. The influx of refugees saw Gaza's population triple to around 200,000.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s armed Palestinian 'fedayeen' - many of them refugees - mounted attacks into Israel, drawing reprisals. The United Nations set up a refugee agency, UNRWA, which today provides services for 1.3 million registered Palestine refugees in Gaza, around 70 per cent of the population, as well as for Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank.\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. An Israeli census that year put Gaza's population at 394,000, at least 60 percent of them refugees. It found that 65 percent of working-age men in the 145 sq. mile (375 sq. km) territory were employed in Gaza before the 1967 conflict, mainly in agriculture, fishing, industry and quarries.\nTwenty years after the 1967 war, Palestinians launched their first intifada, or uprising. It began in December 1987 after a traffic accident in which an Israeli truck crashed into a vehicle carrying Palestinian workers in Gaza's Jabalya refugee camp, killing four. Stone-throwing protests, strikes and shutdowns followed.\nSeizing the angry mood, the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood created an armed Palestinian branch - Hamas - with its power base in Gaza. Hamas, dedicated to Israel's destruction and restoration of Islamic rule in what it saw as occupied Palestine, became a rival to Yasser Arafat's secular Fatah party that led the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nHamas and Islamic Jihad carried out bombings to try to derail the peace process, leading Israel to impose more restrictions on movement of Palestinians out of Gaza. Hamas also picked up on growing Palestinian criticisms of corruption, nepotism and economic mismanagement by Arafat's inner circle.\nOne casualty was Gaza International Airport, a symbol of thwarted Palestinian hopes for economic independence and the Palestinians' only direct link to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel or Egypt. Opened in 1998, was deemed a security threat by Israel three years later. Israel destroyed its radar antenna and runway a few months after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.\nAnother casualty was Gaza's fishing industry, a source of income for tens of thousands. Gaza's fishing zone, set by the Oslo deals at 20 nautical miles, was reduced by Israel to between three and 12 nautical miles. Israel said the restrictions were necessary to stop boats smuggling weapons. Palestinians accused Israel of reneging on Oslo.\nPalestinians tore down the abandoned buildings and infrastructure for scrap. The settlements' removal led to greater freedom of movement within Gaza, and the 'tunnel economy' boomed as armed groups, smugglers and entrepreneurs quickly dug scores of tunnels into Egypt.\nLater that year, Hamas militants captured an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, and killed two others in a tunnel raid. In 2007 Hamas seized full control of Gaza, overthrowing forces loyal to Arafat's successor, President Mahmoud Abbas.\nIsrael stopped tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from entering the country, cutting off an important source of income, and closed an industrial zone on the Gaza border.\nIsraeli air strikes crippled Gaza's only electrical power plant, causing widespread blackouts. Citing security concerns, Israel and Egypt also imposed tighter restrictions on the movement of people and goods through the Gaza crossings.\nGaza's economy increasingly went underground, becoming more dependent on a network of smuggling tunnels under the border with Egypt. Ambitious Hamas plans to refocus Gaza's economy east, away from Israel, foundered before they even started.\nEgypt's newly elected president, Mohammed Mursi, was overthrown after just a year. Viewing Hamas as a threat, Egypt's new military-backed leader, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, closed the border with Gaza and blew up most of the tunnels. Once again isolated, Gaza's economy went into reverse.\nGaza's economy has suffered repeatedly over decades in the cycle of conflict, attack and retaliation between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, from the 1970s to recent years.\nPresident Donald Trump announced the United States would withhold some future aid payments to Palestinians, accusing them of unwillingness to talk peace with Israel. Washington held back $65 million of a first scheduled payment to UNRWA, the U.N. agency that cares for Palestinian refugees.\nIt is unclear how much more, if any, it will contribute. UNRWA received $355 million from the United States in the 2017 fiscal year. UNRWA is funded mainly by voluntary contributions from U.N. member states, with the United States by far the largest donor.",
        "The will-she-or-won\u2019t-she question on Clinton\u2019s turn to the left.\nSenator Bernie Sanders is drawing crowds of thousands at campaign events and gaining momentum at a pace that suggests there is a real Democratic hunger for more populist and progressive\u2014or, as Sanders calls himself, \u201cDemocratic socialist\u201d\u2014policies. That means Hillary Clinton, long presumed to be the front-runner in the fight for the Democratic nomination for president, needs to sharpen her rhetoric on regulation and income inequality.\nDespite sounding an increasingly populist note during her campaign, Clinton is hardly known as a foe of the financial industry. She has given many lucrative speeches at the likes of Goldman Sachs, and her early denouncements of hedge funds and big banks were met with amusement and rolled eyes on the Street.\nSome on Wall Street think powerful populist pitches from former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley and Sanders, coupled with the heavy influence of noncandidate Elizabeth Warren, could force Clinton to come out harder on issues including breaking up the nation\u2019s largest banks, imposing a financial transaction tax, putting individual bankers in jail, cracking down on executive pay, and otherwise beating up on an industry that six years after the financial crisis still suffers from rock-bottom public-opinion ratings.\nClinton is expected to continue to ratchet up the tone she debuted during her \u201clistening tour\u201d of Iowa, when the candidate bemoaned the influence of money in politics and said that low-income truck drivers shouldn\u2019t pay more taxes than hedge-fund managers. Few, however, expect her to go as far as O\u2019Malley, who has called for the prosecution of big bankers, or Sanders, who has openly pushed for breaking up the country\u2019s largest banks.\nIt\u2019s almost refreshing how open nearly all parties are about their belief that Clinton would never argue for reining in the financial industry if she didn\u2019t absolutely have to in order to make her way to the White House. Presumably waiting to see whether she can overcome that perception are Senator Elizabeth Warren and New York mayor Bill de Blasio, both of whom are progressive champions and have yet to endorse Clinton.\nOn the other side of that calculus is Clinton\u2019s donor base, which is richly populated with folks who work on Wall Street. Clinton is struggling to raise the type of money that Bush has already raised before declaring his candidacy, and the Democrats have far fewer donors willing to write checks in the six to eight figure range than the Republicans do.\nAll of this makes for an ugly, rather dispiriting balancing act\u2014one that we can all look forward to watching unfold over the more than 500 days left between today and Election Day.",
        "While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained mainstream notoriety, it remains unlikely any Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) will appear on the New York Stock Exchange any time soon.\nThat prediction comes from Tom Farley, the president of NYSE Group that oversees the New York Stock Exchange. While speaking with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Farley said Bitcoin ETFs still have a ways to go before clearing the necessary regulatory hurdles.\nThere have been a number of efforts to get a Bitcoin ETF off the ground, along with gain similar acceptance for other cryptocurrencies but none of the attempts have proven successful thus far, falling short of gaining approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nPerhaps the most notable failure thus far was the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, backed by twin entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook fame. The effort was rejected by the commission after it found the proposed fund was susceptible to fraud due to the digital currency\u2019s unregulated nature.\nThe concept behind the Winklevoss ETF and others like it is to create a stock fund tied to the price of Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), which would allow investors to purchase the currency without holding it directly. The fund would work in the same way that a person can investment money into another commodity like gold.\nETFs would have helped lower the barrier of entry that comes with the cryptocurrency, which can require some technical know-how. Currently, acquiring cryptocurrency requires people to create a unique bitcoin wallet and the ability to \u201cmine\u201d for bitcoin by lending their computing power to blockchain transactions.\nInvestors in a bitcoin ETF wouldn\u2019t be able to make purchases using Bitcoin but would be able to buy and sell it at its listed value, which would benefit the cryptocurrency economy by creating more liquidity in the market.\nThe SEC is still approaching cryptocurrencies with a critical eye. Earlier this month, the commission raised a number of investor protection concerns about cryptocurrency mutual funds and ETFs in a letter to industry groups.\nIn the letter, the SEC asked questions about the potential for currency manipulation, challenges regarding setting an accurate value for a product tied to volatile markets, and how demand to redeem the virtual currency would be met, among other questions.",

NFL Media's Albert Breer confirmed the receiver's absence was the cause of the suspension, per a source briefed on the situation.\nGordon was suspended for 10 games earlier this year for violating the league's substance-abuse policy.\nAs Breer notes, Gordon missing his 11th game will keep the wideout from accruing a season toward free agency -- players must play in six games to earn a year of eligibility toward becoming a free agent.\nWhether or not the Browns pay Josh Gordon for Sunday's game will determine whether he accrues the year. Gordon can appeal with the NFLPA.\nUpon his return, Gordon didn't look close to the player that led the league in receiving in 2013. Criticized for being out of shape and not on the same page with his quarterbacks, Gordon caught just 14 passes for 249 yards and two touchdowns in five games.\nHe did have some big moments, including an amazing catch against the New England Patriots.\nBut it wasn't nearly enough to get him back into",

The speaker has a small bass port on its rear end, and impedance is listed at 6 ohms.

Andrew Cuomo's decision to withhold federal Disproportionate Share Hospital payments from the city public hospital system \"makes no sense.\"\n\"This is not normal and there is no excuse for it,\" de Blasio said during an unrelated press conference in Manhattan.\nIt was the first time de Blasio publicly commented on the latest spat between the city and state, one the mayor said could \"undermine health care in this city.\"\nThe federal Medicaid DSH payments are provided to hospitals that treat the uninsured and underinsured. NYC Health + Hospitals CEO Stan Brezenoff sent a letter to the state last week demanding the Cuomo administration turn over $380 million he feels his system is owed. Half of that is city dollars which draw down the federal share.\nThe Cuomo administration has noted that the state is facing a $329 million cut to the DSH program in the current fiscal year and the prudent action is to hold on to last year's cash until a plan to address future shortfalls is agreed upon.\nDe Blasio found that absurd.\n\"For the governor somehow to say New York City hospitals should suffer in the meantime makes no sense,\" de Blasio said. \"I think a lot of New Yorkers would be upset by that.

        "My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome \u2014 and yet each is \u201creading\u201d a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development. An increasing body of data suggests this is accomplished by modifying the genome both in the nature of the proteins bound to different sequences and in the spatial organization of those sequences relative to each other. The spatial organization or folding of the genome may be particularly important in complex multicellular organisms, since many of the sequences known to interact based on genetic data are nonetheless substantially separated from each other along the linear genome. By regulating the folding of this linear sequence into a higher order structure, a cell might change which regulatory sequences have access to which genes, and achieve different behavioral states.\nSo far we have little imaging data on how the genome is folded within a cell on the length scale of individual genes, or whether this folding is regulated in any way relevant to the behavior of the cell. Our limited knowledge stems largely from want of a method that has both the resolution and specificity to visualize such genomic substructure. Conventional fluorescent microscopy has developed excellent methods for labeling specific DNA sequences, but cannot resolve structures smaller than about 200 nm.

        "Two of the most successful intelligence disinformation campaigns that survive today were put forth by British Intelligence and the Russian KGB during, and shortly after, World War II.\nDuring World War II, the British made a spectacular technological advancement in the form of early radar that allowed them to target German bombers flying toward England, particularly at night, when they were extraordinarily difficult to intercept. The radar was fabulously successful, and many new British fighter aces were baptized by fire through shooting down German bombers.\nNaturally, they wanted to hide this fact for as long as possible, so we can imagine the long meetings that took place to come up with a plan. One of the golden rules of disinformation is that the best lies are based on truth, a tenet often still used today.\nIn this case, they chose to lie using real information and settled on the fact that carrots are high in Vitamin A, which is a vitamin useful to eyesight. This was the true fact that was then stretched to substantiate the lie that British pilots had extraordinarily good night vision that allowed them to intercept and shoot down so many German bombers at night.\nA substantial propaganda campaign was undertaken to convince the British public of the truth of the false statement, in order to have German spies pick up the information and pass it back to the German military. No clear records are known that indicate if the disinformation campaign had any effect on the Germans, but it was so successful with the public that it benignly lives on to this day.\nThe USSR\u2019s KGB also ran an extremely successful disinformation campaign against the United States during the Cold War. In 1968, the Soviet Union invaded the Czech Socialist Republic (Czechoslovakia) to suppress an internal uprising. At the same time,",

        "Lawn sweepers are more efficient and less time consuming than raking leaves.\n3 What Kind of Rake to Use for Grass Seed?\nLawn sweepers operate with brushes underneath that pick up lawn debris and flip it into a hopper. The process is the same as a vacuum cleaner, but the brushes turn manually as you push a walk-behind sweeper. You may use a lawn sweeper to clean the yard after mowing it, or to clean fallen leaves and debris. An accumulation of dead grass and leaves on your lawn blocks sunlight and air from the grass and can kill the lawn. The process of using a lawn sweeper takes little time and your lawn will thank you for it.\nPut on leather work gloves to protect your hands from thorns or sharp objects. Pick up all branches, rocks, pinecones and other large debris in the area. Lawn sweepers will remove small twigs, grass clippings and leaves, but not large items.\nMow your lawn as you normally would. Lawn sweepers work better on freshly mowed grass that is all the same height.\nAdjust the brush height on a lawn sweeper to the same height as the grass. Some models have a dial to turn or a handle to move forward or backward for brush adjustments. Look under the sweeper and move the adjustment apparatus until the brushes touch the grass.\nStart pushing the lawn sweeper in one corner of your lawn. Travel in paths back and forth across the lawn in opposite directions of either north/south or east/west. Do not travel diagonally across the lawn.\nPush the lawn sweeper at a steady pace without going too fast. If you go too fast, the brushes won't be able to pick up everything.\n",

        "LIVELY is a new online lingerie company that combines the style of traditional lingerie with the comfort of athleisure.\nAdding to its collection of affordable bras ($35), underwear ($10), and swimwear ($45+), LIVELY released a new wireless, strapless bra ($35) that was met with great enthusiasm and is already backordered.\nThough it's not perfect, we found it was a big improvement from the uncomfortable strapless bras we're used to wearing. That the bra manages to provide comfort and support while being wire-free is impressive.\nStrapless bras are the bane of every woman's existence. In an incredible feat of engineering and daring, most strapless bras manage to simultaneously dig into your skin and slip down your chest every few minutes. I personally stopped wearing strapless tops and dresses altogether to avoid this uncomfortable reality. Other times, I've decide I simply don't care enough that my straps are showing.\nFor years, I had to choose between subtlety and comfort, but I recently tried a strapless bra that didn't compromise, and is completely affordable to boot.\nOnline lingerie startup LIVELY launched just two years ago in 2016 behind the leadership of Victoria's Secret veteran Michelle Cordeiro Grant, selling supportive and stylish bras for only $35. From the beginning, strapless bras were in high demand so the company started offering smooth and lace strapless bras the following year.\nNow, LIVELY has made a strapless bra even more comfortable by removing the underwire. The new strapless bra is available in four colors: black, nude, light blue, and pink. It comes in cup sizes A through D and band sizes 32 through 38.\n",

        "Is Incentive Compensation a True Motivator?\nI write about compensation governance.\n\u201cPay for performance\u201d \u2013 the concept that executives\u2019 compensation should be commensurate with the value they deliver to shareholders \u2013 has become a household phrase in recent years. The popular understanding of its meaning reflects the longstanding belief in corporate America that financial incentives are the most powerful motivator of executive performance.\nYet the findings of various studies by behavioral psychologists suggest otherwise. These findings have profound implications for companies large and small, for they raise questions about the motivational rationale underlying incentive compensation programs.\nIn the 1950s, researcher Harry Harlow observed the behavior of monkeys performing relatively complex tasks. Based on these observations, Harlow postulated that the very performance of these tasks was its own reward \u2013 that the monkeys were driven by \u201cintrinsic motivation.\u201d Unfortunately, Harlow did not pursue his remarkable discovery any further \u2013 perhaps because it was too threatening to 1950s beliefs about motivating people with \u201cextrinsic\u201d rewards, otherwise known as money. Starting then and continuing to the present, corporate America has institutionalized a system of incentive compensation supported not by behavioral studies, but by finance research. Extrinsic financial rewards to executives have increased at escalating rates, far surpassing the growth in a typical worker\u2019s pay.\nNearly half a century after Harlow, psychological researchers comprehensively analyzed the results of 128 laboratory studies into the relationships between incentives, motivation and performance. Their findings concerning intrinsic motivation not only confirmed Harlow\u2019s observations, but also extended them to include human subjects. They concluded:\n\n* Intrinsic motivation is an important driver of performance.\n* Extrinsic incentives can actually reduce intrinsic motivation.\n* Extrinsic incentives can actually reduce performance.\n* Extrinsic",

The D-Link DI-714 Wireless Broadband Router ($220 street) and the U.S. Robotics Broadband Router ($150) address these problems by adding analog modem support to the usual list of residential gateway features: a single RJ-45 for a WAN (cable or DSL modem) connection, a four-port 10/100 Ethernet switch, support for NAT and DHCP, internal firewalls, various security features, and Web browser configuration. The D-Link model adds an internal 802.11b wireless access point; the U.S. Robotics model has a printer port to use in conjunction with print server software to install on each network PC.\nWhat sets these two gateways apart is that each also includes a 9-pin serial port for attaching an external analog modem if broadband isn't available.\nInstalling the residential gateways was simple. Also, the D-Link start-up brochure is a model of completeness and clarity.\nThe two gateways worked fine with our multiple-technology and -brand test network, which used an AT&T WorldNet cable modem, a Verizon Fios fiber-optic cable modem, an ADSL2+ DSL modem from Clearwire, and an ISDN line from Qwest.

        "It\u2019s hard to argue that more price transparency in healthcare isn\u2019t needed \u2013 especially as employers increasingly shift to high-deductible plans and Health Savings Accounts that demand more responsibility from their employees.\nBut a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research suggests that price transparency alone could lead consumers to risky conclusions about their need for certain medications and procedures. As part of the study, the researchers, Janet Schwartz of Tulane University\u2019s A.B. Freeman School of Business and Adriana Samper of Arizona State University, gave two groups of people two different flu shot prices, $25 and $125.\nThey found that consumers associated lower medication prices with a greater communal need and, therefore, a greater sense of personal risk and they associated higher prices with less need and less risk. The potential implication: consumers may forgo more expensive medication and procedures on the false belief that they\u2019re less important.\nAs consumer advocates, policy experts and a growing group of startups try to open up the black box of health care costs, it\u2019s an interesting study to keep in mind. And the authors argue that more education about risk and need should accompany price transparency efforts.\nComparison shopping in health care is still in its earliest days, but sites like Castlight Health, ClearCost Health, Clear Health Costs, HealthInReach and PokitDok are trying to give consumers more clarity into health care pricing. Getting the data straight from the providers is tricky (although PokitDok and others have made some progress there), so many of these services rely on claims data from insurance companies or other third parties.\n\u201cPrice transparency is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to empowering patients to make better decisions about their care,\u201d said",

This 17% was on a population base of 350 million or so. At present, over 30% of our population, on a base of 1.2 billion, lives in urban centres.\nBy 2030, when we complete work of the 2030 Development Agenda, nearly 600 million Indians, or 40% of our population, will reside in urban spaces. To lay further emphasis on India\u2019s urban prospects \u2013 from now till 2030, India has to build 700 to 900 million square meters of urban space every year.\nIn other words, India will have to build a new Chicago every year from now till 2030 to meet its urban demand. More importantly, the new urban infrastructure India builds for 2030, 70% of which still needs to be constructed, will have to be green and resilient.\nThis is a huge challenge, but it is also an enormous opportunity. We see the rapid growth of our cities not just as a problem to be solved, but also as an opportunity to be seized.\nThe Indian Government, under the dynamic leadership of",

And \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d currently enjoying its American premiere at Yale Repertory Theatre through Nov. 17, thrives on its simplicity in physical production design, words and performance. This 70-minute allegory fairly ripples with sprawling wisdom and compassion.\nTheatergoers familiar with Brook, universally esteemed as one of the most important and uniquely imaginative directors over the past 60 years, recognize his spare style, which he describes at length in his 1968 book \u201cThe Empty Space.\u201d Indeed, \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d has an ancient, tribal feel to its storytelling, but not because it\u2019s set in a primitive Afghanistan village on the outskirts of a desert. Rather, it\u2019s due to the way that Brook and Estienne (both credited with text and direction) use but a handful of actors and a virtually bare stage to spark our imagination.\nOne actor directly addresses the audience as our ancestors did, sitting around the proverbial fire.

        "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is opposed to even limited U.S. military intervention in Syria because it believes rebels fighting the Assad regime wouldn't support American interests if they were to seize power right now, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote to a congressman in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.\nEffectively ruling out U.S. cruise missile attacks and other options that wouldn't require U.S. troops on the ground, Dempsey said the military is clearly capable of taking out Syrian President Bashar Assad's air force and shifting the balance of the Arab country's 2 1/2-year war back toward the armed opposition. But he said such an approach would plunge the United States deep into another war in the Arab world and offer no strategy for peace in a nation plagued by ethnic rivalries.\n\"Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,\" Dempsey said in the letter Aug. 19 to Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. \"It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.\"\nDempsey's pessimistic assessment will hardly please members of the fractured Syrian opposition leadership and some members of the administration who have championed greater support to help the rebellion end Assad's four-decade family dynasty. Despite almost incessant bickering and infighting, the opposition has made significant gains in recent months, seizing large swaths of territory from government forces.\nBut as the civil war enters its third year, with more than 100,000 dead and millions displaced,",

If Green Touch hits its targets, the new equipment will run for three years on the power that current systems use up in just one day, said Gee Rittenhouse, vice president of research at Bell Labs and the head of Green Touch.\n\"What we're trying to do is really think about it afresh,\" said Rittenhouse, a longtime researcher at the lab. Whereas vendors today design products for high performance while also considering power requirements, Green Touch is going to design them for efficiency first while also keeping performance in mind.\n\"Normally, the research done today is about taking today's network and refining it ... instead of erasing the board, starting from an open mind, and building up from there,\" Rittenhouse said. The power-saving technology available today, even if it were applied throughout all networks, would only keep power consumption flat over the coming years, he said.\n\"We've got to do better than that,\" Rittenhouse said. \"It can't be business as usual.\"\nThe consortium will include 12 companies, 10 academic institutions and two national labs, including the U.S.'s Argonne",

The Mission report recommends that the Security Council require Israel and the authorities in Gaza to report to it, within six months, on investigations and prosecutions it should carry out with regard to the violations identified by the Mission.\nThe Mission recommends that the Security Council set up a body of independent experts to report to it on the progress of the Israeli and Palestinian investigations and prosecutions.

The bill would prohibit checkoff programs from engaging in anticompetitive activities or disparaging rival products or commodities.\nThe nation\u2019s 22 checkoff boards promote individual agricultural commodities such as lamb, peanuts, avocados, pork, potatoes and cotton, and are probably best known for creating promotional campaigns for beef (It\u2019s What\u2019s for Dinner), eggs (The Incredible Edible Egg) and dairy (Got Milk?). The USDA oversees checkoff programs and collects the mandatory fees from producers.\nEmails obtained through a FOIA request revealed that American Egg Board leaders and top executives in the egg industry had hoped to slow the growth of an egg-free mayonnaise competitor, Just Mayo, by working with a public relations agency and attempting to keep the product off of Whole Foods shelves. Board leaders had also discussed notifying the Food and Drug Administration about what they believed was Just Mayo\u2019s misleading name.\nThe USDA opened an investigation of the American Egg Board, which is ongoing, after the emails were released.\nAnother controversy erupted this May when House Republicans included language in the proposed 2017 House Agricultural Appropriations bill that would exempt checkoff programs from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.

But for the struggling arts infrastructure elsewhere across the nation, which doesn't rely on tourist hordes, the New York event is pretty much a snooze.\nLast month the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., opened its new American art galleries. On May 30, the Huntington Library and Art Galleries in San Marino will open its new Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art. In the fall of 2010 the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston will open its new American art wing. All three museums have received major gifts from private donors, but all are also counting on public funds to help them complete their projects. So far, however, the federal stimulus package has not included any money earmarked for museum construction or renovation -- even though",
        "\u201cHoneywell? What do they make?\u201d I was asked this question on more than one occasion before attending Honeywell\u2019s media day in Phoenix, Arizona a couple weeks ago. In so many words, the answer is \u201ceverything, really.\u201d Although Honeywell plays an integral part in the aviation industry, it is almost all behind the scenes.\nHoneywell Engine HTF7000, used in mid-sized business jets, in production. Image courtesy Honeywell.\nFrom nose to tail, Honeywell probably crams more components into a typical aircraft than any other firm. To the average passenger, Honeywell is probably known as the manufacturer of their home thermostat from 1972. In the aircraft, however, Honeywell manufactures auxiliary power units, engines, avionics, complex air conditioning systems, radar systems, critical safety systems, and even in-flight WiFi hardware.\nAt their facility located just outside of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Honeywell kicked off a two day media event to give journalists, bloggers, and industry players a close look at exactly what it does. At this facility, Honeywell manufactures its jet engines and auxiliary power units (APU), which are essentially smaller jet engines located in the tail of the aircraft to supply electrical power and compressed air to the aircraft when needed. Both the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family of aircraft use Honeywell APUs. The brand new Airbus A350 does as well, using Honeywell\u2019s largest APU ever produced.\nThe company also produces the entire cockpit system for the Embraer Phenom 100 and 300 light business jets, including flight controls, displays, and navigation equipment. Honeywell also has a partnership with Rockwell Collins to",
        "SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Learn the art of compromise with this boozy chocolate mousse recipe. This year, I turned to the ready-to-use cake mix from Betty Crocker. I added two tablespoons of Cointreau to the cake mix for extra flavour.\nThe chocolate mousse recipe is adapted from a Belgian friend's recipe and combined with the recipe from the eighth edition of The Professional Chef by The Culinary Institute of America. My friend's recipe does not contain cream, but I find whipped cream gives the mousse a smoother texture.\nAdd a dash of colour with fresh raspberries, blackberries, mint, store-bought whipped cream, and use a vegetable peeler to shave chocolate as a topping. Best to consume the chocolate mousse the next day.\n1. Heat a saucepan with water 3cm deep. Keep the heat on low, as the water should be simmering, barely boiling. Over the saucepan, place a metal bowl with the chocolate and butter. Stir to make sure the chocolate is melted evenly. Once the chocolate is melted, turn off the heat and set it aside to cool to room temperature.\n2. Add 1 tablespoon of the Cointreau and rum each to the chocolate mixture and stir. Set aside.\n3. Place egg yolks in a dry mixing bowl and beat for 30 seconds. Add sugar. Continue beating until the mixture is pale yellow.\n4. Add the chocolate mixture into the beaten egg yolks.

By moving security protection to the network level, Box products protect all the devices on the network, including fridges, game consoles, and security cameras.\nWith V2, the Bitdefender Box gets a makeover; the slim, white Apple TV-esque box has been swapped for a tall and conical gadget reminiscent of the Asus Google OnHub router, but with panels of clean, white plastic accented with black strips. A blue LED beneath one of the plastic panels displays the status, similar to the color-changing effect on the Google Home.\nThe original Bitdefender Box includes the company's malware protection, which PCMag has reviewed favorably in the past. A URL blacklist also protects against malicious websites, and a vulnerability assessment can ferret out poorly configured devices on your network. The original Box also has device management tools, letting you see all the devices on your network and set policies for them. A unique feature of Box is Private Line, a VPN-like service that allows users to browse the web without revealing their true IP address.\n<strong>See How We Test Routers</strong>\n\nThe new version of the Box will include all those features, along with some improvements. The most notable change is that Box V2 will be able",

What do you think they have taught you?\nDo you think video games can help inspire social change? Have you ever played one that helped you understand a serious global problem?\nThis year, a United Nations program devoted to urban planning in countries affected by poverty or natural disasters began developing a sports field in the slums of Kibera, Kenya, designing it in the popular sandbox video game Minecraft. The game, which allows players to build entire worlds out of cubes in a 3-D environment, helped the project leaders create a visual representation of the field that could be easily understood by the neighborhood\u2019s residents.\nThe project, known as Block by Block, is among the highlights this week at the Games for Change Festival in New York, an annual event that promotes video games that seek social change. These efforts \u2014 known as serious games \u2014 once focused on education, to entice students to learn through digital play. But attention has shifted to more ambitious efforts like Block by Block, and a large part of that push has come from Games for Change, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that has worked with Google, NASA, the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation and TEDx.\nOne speaker at this year\u2019s festival is Zoran Popovic, the director of the Center for Game Science at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He will talk about his research into how games can help people make sense of complex scientific concepts, like climate change.\n\u201cGames are very good at helping people visualize things,\u201d said Mr. Popovic, who is also a professor of computer science",

Amazon will derive steady revenue from more than 460 Whole Foods stores; it can also introduce robots and other automation technologies to cut costs and improve the bottom line. But ultimately, Amazon wants to sell even more goods and services to both online and offline shoppers \u2014 including stuff they might not even realize they need.\nAmazon has been quiet on its specific plans so far, but analysts are enthusiastic about the possibilities. \"This will be a fun time for Amazon,\" said Ryne Misso of the Market Track retail research firm in Chicago. \"They are introducing a whole new set of shopper profiles that span grocery stores and durables.\"\nAmazon is a pro at using data on past shopping and browsing to prod you to buy more.

Let\u2019s call these collaborative ecosystem applications platforms. Marshall Van Alstyne explained the logic of these platforms in his book Platform Revolution. We should all be excited about such applications.\nIn a technological sense, blockchain is key for creating an unalterable, trusted record of certain types of transactions. But the problem is that blockchain tech isn\u2019t really needed for all collaborative ecosystem applications.\nSo, how can each of us figure out what blockchain really means to us? When is the excitement about blockchain about a collaborative ecosystem application that does not in actuality need blockchain? When do such apps really require blockchain?

        "Merck has been taking heat for the price it paid for Idenix -- Here's why it actually isn't as crazy as it sounds.\nRecently, the pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK) has been receiving a bit of heat from commentators who believe that the company offered way too much money for the hepatitis c therapeutics developer Idenix Pharmaceuticals (UNKNOWN:IDIX.DL) last week. Although the $3.85 billion acquisition gives Merck full rights to a promising mid-stage hepatitis c drug called samatasvir, many people believe that Gilead's (NASDAQ:GILD) blockbuster hep c drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) may deplete most of the market by the time Merck's combo (including samatasvir) can apply for FDA approval.\nIf we are limiting our discussion to the US hep c patient population, I would fully agree that Merck made an unfavorable bet with its bid for Idenix. However, many people seem to miss the fact that the US only has about 2% of the world's hep c patients. Even if Gilead utterly dominates the US market for hep c in the next 3-4 years, Merck can target well over 100 million non-US patients who have few (if any) options for elimination of the virus.\nOutside the US, Merck wouldn't be able to match the prices that Gilead currently charges for a 12-week regimen of Sovaldi and ribavirin, but it could still charge significantly higher prices than what is available in developing countries today. According to a recent report from the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), the average annual cost of treating one patient with hep",

But before he begins college, he plans to go on a two-year church mission after he finishes his high school academic requirements in December. If he wasn't in the same class as Pinnacle's Spencer Rattler, he would be the No. 1 quarterback in Arizona.

But until this season, he\u2019s had to play Richard on a single, subdued, sustained note of enigmatic cool. In \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d he almost literally made Richard into another character, showing us the decent, desperate, heartbroken man who would be transformed over 140 years as Jacob\u2019s ambassador on the Island.\nIt may have seemed like a lot of time spent to some viewers, but clearly Cuse and Lindelof thought they needed to show, not just tell, the circumstances that brought Richard to his current pass.

But despite a slew of world-class offensive talent, the Hawks never have had a world-class power play. Not even coach Joel Quenneville\u2019s renowned tinkering seems to make a significant impact.\nThe hope heading into the playoffs was that Kane\u2019s return would give the power play a boost. It worked in Game 1, when Kane assisted on Patrick Sharp\u2019s 5-on-3 goal in the second period and then fed Jonathan Toews for a standard power-play goal 5:18 later to cap a comeback from a 3-3 deficit in the Hawks\u2019 4-3 double-overtime victory.\nBut since then, the Hawks are 0-for-13 on the power play. They are 0-for-6 at home in the series. Overall, the Hawks are tied for 11th among the 16 playoff teams in power play efficiency (2-of-17, 11.8 percent).\nThe Hawks made some adjustments before Game 6, including moving defenseman Johnny Oduya up to the first power-play unit and inserting Brandon Saad in place of Andrew Shaw.

What exactly did it mean to have something \u201cin the cloud\u201d? Was your personal information just floating around somewhere, ready for people to steal? Now, a lot of those hesitations have disappeared as people learned more about the cloud and its benefits. Businesses and individuals are more than willing to stick their information \u201cin the cloud,\u201d but it\u2019s really not that simple.\nSure, there are plenty of cloud providers in the market, but choosing the right one for your organization can be a tricky process. Brand name cloud providers are often seen as a reliable option for companies, but the truth is that they may not be the right option for your small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) needs.\nMigrating successfully to the cloud requires a SMB to have the right partner by its side, especially if it lacks cloud expertise or the time to develop an appropriate migration strategy. The right partner will be able to ensure that a SMB\u2019s cloud deployment meets regulatory requirements, offers future scalability and flexibility, and/or provides it with the most cost-effective option possible.\nAgain, finding a cloud provider that can do all of the above should be easy, but that\u2019s not always the case.

Ms. Grande's message of \"inclusiveness\" following the Manchester, England, terror attack after one of her concerts won out over Mr. Mattis' \"kill them all\" approach.\n\"The strategy of annihilation is sort of like fighting forest fires with gasoline hoses,\" the professor wrote for The Nation in a piece titled \"Ariana Grande Understands Counterterrorism Better Than Jim Mattis.\"\n\"In [a recent] interview, Mattis showed no interest in how ISIL arose in the first place, or how it attracted or gained the tacit cooperation of several million Syrians and Iraqis,\" Mr. Cole wrote of the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. \"He seems to think that a few slick tweets or videos in cyberspace are the problem. The fact is that all the ISIL fighters in Iraq and Syria have siblings and cousins, and simply annihilating them creates a whole slew of new feuds with the United States.\"\nThe professor claimed that Iraq's Shiite militias, which are backed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, are more effective than U.S.-led coalition airstrikes in driving the Islamic State from its strongholds.\nMr. Mattis has been critical of Iran'",

Its finding, released in October, is based on a survey of households across income categories and across India.\nSince October, estimates on the rate at which the global and Indian economies will grow this year and next have been significantly downscaled \u2014which means that discretionary spending could slow more than Indicus\u2019 estimates, maybe even contract.\nIn recent weeks, the International Monetary Fund has said India is expected to grow 7.8% in 2008 and 6.3% next year, down from its earlier estimate of 9% for both years. The World Bank has also cut its growth forecasts for the same period by about 1 percentage points.\nBut there is no denying that people are spending less. In some cases,",

Former winners Baron Corbin and Mojo Rawley were among the final competitors too, as they looked to claim yet another big win ahead of the WrestleMania 34 pay-per-view.\nAs reported on Sunday night by Pro Wrestling, the big men\u2019s battle royal featured a number of competitors who weren\u2019t previously announced, as well as those superstars who were.

In other parts of the match, Kane shoved multiple opponents out of the ring at once. Mojo Rawley hit a huge shoulder tackle on Ryder as he was preparing for a running move, which eliminated Ryder from the match.\nZiggler, Kane, and Goldust all ended up being eliminated from the match too, leaving an interesting final three competitors.

During the debut episode, Russo talked about why Roman Reigns got booed at Royal Rumble 2015 and why Seth Rollins is not over with the fans.\nAccording to Russo, Reigns got booed out of the building at Royal Rumble 2015 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania because WWE unnecessarily put Daniel Bryan in the over-the-top-rope battle royal and Reigns was left in the match with other performers who had no chance of winning and going on to headline WrestleMania 31.\n\"It had a lot to do with putting Daniel Bryan in that match, which they didn't have to put him in, having him eliminated, leaving Reigns in there with three other guys that had no chance of winning the match, so they put Reigns in a horrible position. The people booed him out of the building.\" Russo continued, \"From that day on, from where I sit, my professional opinion is that the WWE has been catering to the internet, the internet wrestling community, the small audience with the loudest voice! Everything they said they weren't going to do, now they are doing. They are catering to that crowd, which they already have. The casual fans are no longer watching the product.\"\nRusso also talked about why he doesn't think Seth Rollins is drawing money for the company. He feels that Rollins should be getting cheered more by the fans than he currently is.\n\"I'm telling you right",

        "Uber is now facing tough questions from Congress over a data breach last year that affected as many as 57 million user and driver accounts. It was revealed last week that the ride-hailing company paid $100,000 to hackers who accessed the user data in exchange for their silence.\nThe incident, which occurred more than a year ago and was kept under wraps, has raised concerns about what a responsible disclosure should look like in the wake of a major security breach. Furthermore, questions linger over whether Uber was acting in the best interest of its users or whether it was mostly concerned about its own image when it paid the hackers to delete the stolen data.\nThe stolen data, which included email addresses, phone numbers, and driver\u2019s license numbers, was discovered by hackers on an Amazon server, which they accessed using credentials lifted from a private GitHub site used by Uber software engineers. Although it could be argued that handing over $100,000 to hackers is a small price to pay\u2014the so called \u201ccost of doing business\u201d\u2014there doesn\u2019t seem to be any conceivable way that Uber could\u2019ve ensured that the hackers actually deleted the data after receiving their hush money.\nBoth Joe Sullivan, Uber\u2019s chief security officer, and Craig Clark, a lawyer who reported to him, were fired because of the incident. On Thursday it was reported that Uber\u2019s new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over for Travis Kalanick earlier this year, has hired former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to conduct an internal investigation into how the hack was handled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that we have a lot of work to do to rebuild trust with",

Tony Guerrera, the co-chairman of the legislature's transportation committee, said that if the bill receives final approval, Tesla will be authorized to operate three stores to sell directly to customers throughout the state. Tesla is expected to create 25 to 75 jobs in Connecticut if those stores are opened. The high-performance, luxury cars are manufactured in California and can range in price from $70,000 to $140,000.\nThe bill was crafted to apply only to Tesla. The measure applies to companies that manufacture only electric cars, have no franchise agreements with any car dealer and sell only the cars that it manufactures.\nThe measure still requires approval by the Senate and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy.\nAn earlier version of the bill provided for five stores, but the compromise bill passed by the House on Thursday dropped that figure to three.\nRep. Thomas O'Dea, a Republican from Trumbull, said he opposed the bill because it would set a precedent for allowing other car companies to bypass the traditional dealership model.\n\"I don't believe we should be picking winners and losers,\" he told his colleagues before the vote",
        "Carroll County residents loudly told their legislative delegation yesterday that they do not want to rush the creation of a county police department and they want the matter to go to referendum.\nMany criticized the county commissioners' decision in October to create a county police force and to give themselves the power to appoint its chief.\n\"The commissioners are really wrong on this point, and I ask that they change their minds,\" said Harold Forney, a county resident who was among about 200 people gathered for a 2 1/2 -hour hearing on the topic. \"This centralizes law enforcement under the commissioners. What the county commissioners desire to do is take away that watchdog.\"\nThe decision to create the county force came after years of discussion about abolishing the resident trooper program, which has been based at the state police barracks in Westminster.\nThe resident troopers have been the county's primary law enforcement for more than 30 years. But change has become necessary as Carroll County's population has swelled to about 170,000.\nEven before the public hearing began, state Sen. Larry E. Haines won applause for voicing concerns about the timing of creating a police department.\n\"Have the commissioners even discussed that maybe this is an issue to go to public referendum?\" he asked. \"I don't see the need to rush this thing going through for July 1. I think we're moving too fast.\"\nThe delegation is expected to vote next week on whether to send a bill to the General Assembly that would create the county force. If it passes, the bill would be sent to Gov. Parris N. Glendening for his signature.\nIf the delegation votes against sending",

        "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The head of the International Monetary Fund warned Wednesday that leading nations need to embrace bold policy steps to accelerate a still-modest and fragile global economic recovery.\nIMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that as the world still struggles to emerge from the 2008 financial crisis, economies are under threat from tensions involving Ukraine and Russia to inaction in countries that should be driving growth.\nLagarde said the European Central Bank, for example, should consider lowering interest rates further and using unconventional policies to support growth and fight inflation that is too low.\nHer comments came in a speech previewing next week's meetings of global finance officials in Washington. The 188-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank, will hold their spring policy meetings.\nIn advance of those weekend discussions, finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 leading economic powers will also meet. The United States will be represented by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.\nIn her remarks, Lagarde noted that the G-20 finance officials in a February meeting in Australia had committed to pursuing policies that would boost global GDP by more than $2 trillion over the coming five years.\nLagarde said if the G-20 countries can do so, it would \"place the global economy on a substantially different and better trajectory from today.\"\nLagarde said she thinks the global economy is turning the corner from the deep recession that followed the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market in 2008. She said the world is growing at an annual rate of about 3 percent.\nBut she cautioned: \"The recovery remains weak and",

After adjusting both the current and prior-year quarters for costs to convert the No. 3 paper machine at the company's Wallula, Washington mill to linerboard, Packaging Corp. reported EPS of $2.23, which outpaced Q3 2017's $1.68 in earnings by an impressive 33%. Below, we'll walk through key highlights from the earnings report that shareholders should consider when evaluating Packaging Corp.'s current condition.\nPackaging segment revenue rose 14% year over year, to $1.5 billion, driving total revenue up 10.4%, to $1.8 billion, and compensating for a slight decline in the paper segment, which dipped 6.3%, to $254.3 million.\nAs I discussed earlier this year, Packaging Corp. has fine-tuned its manufacturing operations over the last several quarters to take advantage of surging demand for cardboard packaging versus paper. The most visible aspect of this shift is the conversion of Wallula No. 3 from paper to packaging.\nDuring the last three months, the company hit record third-quarter corrugated shipments of 1.2 billion square feet, representing a 10% increase compared to the same period a year ago.

        "Can Twitter keep up its strong revenue growth?\nFor the most part, 2018 was a good year for Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) business. Sure, monthly active users turned downward in Q2 and Q3. But this was due to the company's aggressive (and important) efforts to improve the health of its platform. In addition, Twitter's year-over-year revenue growth rates accelerated as the year went on.\nBut there's still one more quarter from 2018 for Twitter to report. The company will release its fourth-quarter update on Feb. 7. Following a period of accelerating revenue growth and four consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability, expectations are high. Can Twitter deliver?\nHere's a preview of some key items to watch when Twitter reports fourth-quarter results.\nTwitter's top-line growth has been impressive recently. Third-quarter revenue increased 29% year over year -- an acceleration from 24% revenue growth in Q2. This momentum has been driven by broad-based growth across Twitter's various ad products and geographies.\nThough management didn't provide a forecast for its fourth-quarter revenue, Twitter CFO Ned Segal sounded confident during the company's third-quarter earnings call, noting that the company feels \"really good about the momentum that we've got going into the seasonally strong fourth quarter.\"\nAnalysts, on average, are expecting Twitter's fourth-quarter revenue to increase 26% year over year. If Twitter can beat these estimates, it would be yet another positive data point for investors.\nIt's no secret that Twitter is working hard to combat spam and abuse",
        "Throughout my public career \u2014 as a City Council member, state representative and secretary of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice \u2014 I worked to help children follow a path to success in life and, in particular, to restore hope for young black men. That explains the Florida Council on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys, which I sponsored in 2006 as a legislator, and my strong support for public education as a linchpin for a child's overall success.\nThe education facts are painfully clear. In Pinellas County last year, only 28 percent of black students read at grade level, and only 26 percent performed math at grade level. The latest Schott Foundation report is numbing, placing the graduation rate for black males in the county at 28 percent.\nThis is the kind of social crisis that should bring us all together, cause us to roll up our sleeves and pitch in to help. So it is good news that a circuit judge in Tallahassee recently tossed out a constitutional challenge to an education option that is helping 70,000 of Florida's most underprivileged students \u2014 a disproportionate percentage of whom are black.\nThe Florida Tax Credit Scholarship, which is helping 2,621 poor children mostly of color to attend 74 private schools in Pinellas this year, is not a substitute for the kind of great public schools that I have spent my life supporting. But it deserves a seat at the public-education table because it has proven to be a lifeline for so many young people who would otherwise be left behind.\nI know from personal experience how important school choice can be. My mother was a single parent with limited means, but she made sure",

The Thomas Fire, wildfires all over the West, Santa Paula\u2019s turnover of fire service to the county, Ventura\u2019s budget negotiations with its fire department \u2014 fire is an ever-present story. I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to add a little more fuel to this fire discussion.\nSeveral years ago, Sacramento Bee columnist Dan Walters wrote an opinion piece discussing how, with the increases in wildfires in California and mutual aid arrangements, more and more city fire departments were siphoning off their own resources to aid those firefights.\nMeanwhile, at a couple of state Local Agency Formation Commission conferences a few years ago, there were panels discussing how several counties around the state were consolidating their fire departments into a single agency. Maybe it\u2019s time to begin that discussion here.\nWith Santa Paula joining the Ventura County Fire Department, the recent budget scrutiny over the city of Ventura\u2019s expenditure for fire department requests, and the continued need for the city of Oxnard to stabilize its budget, is it time to finally look at one countywide fire service?\nI raise this issue for several reasons. One, with the increase in wildfires, it seems there is a constant hit on city resources to help fight these blazes. It would seem to make sense that if we had one countywide system, we could better allocate resources when needed.\nTwo, with so much talk about climate change, it seems we are going to see more frequent and severe",

        "The hope is that at least some of the pilot studies will provide results that help in a shorter amount of time.\nA little more than two years after the announcement of a landmark partnership between the NFL and Harvard Medical School for a long-term study on the aftereffects of football on retired players, it is progressing better than many involved expected.\nSpurred by a number of factors: growing concerns over the long-term effects of concussions, the suicides of multiple retired players, growing national sentiment that football was too dangerous, a Harvard study showing the life expectancy for former professional players in the United States and Canada is 20 years less than the general male population, the NFL Players Association decided to take things into its own hands.\nThe union dedicated $100 million over 10 years to fund what is now known as the Football Players Health Study at Harvard, though the project is much more than the extensive survey, which seeks to identify the myriad health problems former players face.\nThe project got under way in February 2014, with the survey and three pilot studies launched immediately. Four studies have since been added, selected after the medical teams received dozens of proposals.\nTo date, more than 2,100 former players have completed the health survey.

Otherwise, America is doomed if Bush's reelection is based on his economic and foreign policy record.\nCan you imagine our peril if Bush's mandate is for unprecedented trade and budget deficits and job loss? Or for taking the country to war based on incompetence or deception?\nThankfully, the electorate did not give Bush a mandate for getting thousands of Americans killed and maimed for no other reason than the Bush administration's inability to assess the intent and capability of Iraq.\nBush's reelection is not a mandate for establishing a dozen or more permanent US military bases in Iraq and expanding the war to Syria, Lebanon, and Iran.\nIf Bush limits his second term to homosexual marriage and abortion, we and the world will be a lot safer. Medical doctors will not stop putting the mother's life first, and homosexuals are no more in need of marriage than the large percentage of heterosexuals who have abandoned it. Homosexual marriage has never been much more than a way to assert legitimacy that most rubs opponents' noses in the proverbial.\nIf Americans allow Cheney, Bush and their neoconservative masters to claim a mandate for preemptive attack against misbehaving nations, then we can kiss democracy good-bye.

        "BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - China will scale back its subsidies for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles faster than expected, while declining to give subsidies to traditional hybrids, according to policy documents posted on the finance ministry\u2019s website on Wednesday.\nThe final version of the policy largely confirmed a previously released draft in setting levels for new energy vehicle subsidies in 2016, but will scale back those subsidies by 20 percent in 2017-2018 and by 40 percent in 2019-2020.\nThe draft had only called for two 10-percent reductions by 2020.\nTraditional hybrid, which rely mostly on gasoline engines, remains a key peg of many company\u2019s strategies in China, with Toyota Motor aiming to launch Corolla and Levin hybrid models later this year and Geely Automobile working on a hybrid version of its Emgrand 7 midsize sedan.\nBy rolling back subsidies faster, the government wants to pressure automakers to reduce their currently high price for new energy vehicles, rather than relying on subsidies to profit, said Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight in Shanghai.\nThe highest subsidy for a single car is roughly 100,000 yuan ($16,119.7), as local authorities generally offer subsidies to match those of the central government, so a 20-40 percent cut would be significant.\n\u201cThis is an important move because it shows that they are trying to get rid of the dependence on subsidies,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can do without subsidies, the market can develop more healthily.\u201d\nChina",

The brand\u2019s new Grain & Seed Bars, the only bars on the market to combine three types of the ancient grain sorghum, are the first to receive the certification; and its plant-based Protein Bites will follow in June, for a total of eight SKUs in all.\nPalm oil is the most used vegetable oil in the world, according to World Wildlife Fund, and is found in everything from ice cream to laundry detergent. Unfortunately, conventional production has resulted in significant negative environmental and social impact, including large-scale deforestation that\u2019s endangering the future of orangutans. In 2017, The New York Times reported that the Bornean orangutan\u2019s population had declined by more than 80 percent in the last 75 years largely because of habitat loss.

        "The fire that broke out underneath elevated Metro-North tracks in Manhattan and caused crippling problems on the busy rail line appears to have been sparked by an accidental fuel spill, fire marshals said Wednesday.\nThe blaze started Tuesday night at a garden center underneath Metro-North tracks in East Harlem when fuel was spilled on a hot generator during refueling, according to FDNY fire marshals.\nThe resulting blaze burned so intensely that it damaged a center column beneath a viaduct holding the elevated tracks, forcing crews to install six temporary steel columns until permanent repairs could be made.\n168 firefighters were called to the blaze, which also engulfed construction debris and several trailers and vehicles. One firefighter suffered a minor injury when he slipped, but no one else was hurt.\nThe city, who owns the lot where the firewood and other flammable material were being stored underneath the track, says it's looking into whether the gardening business that was leasing the space violated any regulations.\nThe fire caused crippling problems on the rail line Tuesday night and forced rail officials to curtail service until at least Friday.\nMetro-North said two of the four tracks in the area of the fire were operational for Wednesday's morning rush. Trains were slowed from their normal 60 mph to 30 mph as repairs continue. The fire caused damage to a center column beneath elevated tracks.\nMetro-North encouraged customers to work from home Wednesday or to take an alternate route. Trains were operating on a modified Saturday schedule, with trains running every half hour between Grand Central Terminal and White Plains.\n\"We're going to get this fixed,\" MTA Chairman Patrick Foye told reporters Tuesday. \"But we want people to understand that there is going to be some impact",

Reiss (search), who owns one of the 1,366 seats on the exchange and was an active floor trader until last year, turned himself in at Manhattan police station, the New York Police Department confirmed.

        "If ever a group set out to be teeth-grindingly annoying it is Gorillaz, Damon Albarn's 'other' band. In fact they're less a band than a virtual supergroup comprising four cartoons conceived by the Blur frontman and his one-time flatmate, illustrator Jamie Hewlett. Worse, they labour under names like Noodle and 2D and converse in character when they give interviews, most of which boast little else save knowing doggerel. You couldn't make it up - except, sadly, someone has.\nStill, all of it would be just about forgivable had their eponymous debut been magnificent. It was not. Its conceit - that a group of animated characters render our obsession with an artist's age and looks redundant - was marginally more interesting than the actual songs, which notwithstanding the spring-heeled, colourful 'Clint Eastwood' were demos with pretensions. Not so this new album.\nWhere its predecessor was the work of a core group of musicians, Demon Days is Damon with some help from umpteen friends. Of these the most notable is hip hop's Danger Mouse, the producer whose namesake is a Seventies cartoon and who shares Albarn's disregard for musical apartheid, as evidenced by his highly prized Beatles-based Grey Album.\nIt, however, pales beside the bulk of Demon Days, which juxtaposes hip hop's youthful brio and invention with an intimacy that evokes Blur's most recent album, 13. The results are often startling. On 'Feel Good Inc', for example, Albarn's falsetto croons over the top of a thumping dance beat while De La Soul rapper Posdnuos rhymes: \"I'",

        "An analysis published this weekend by the Wall Street Journal contends \u2013 as has Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the past year \u2013 that Gulf States led by Saudi Arabia are slowly but definitely beginning to change their attitudes toward Israel.\nJournalist Yaroslav Trofimov writes the impetus behind the move comes from concern over the danger coming from the Shi\u2019ite Islamic Republic of Iran.\nAs they generally do when faced with a dilemma, the Saudi leadership has found a way to smooth over the difficulties posed by the seeming discrepancy of drawing closer to Israel after decades of outright anti-Semitism and hate.\nTrofimov quotes Mohammad bin Abdul Karim al-Issa, former Saudi Justice Minister and secretary-general of the global Saudi-based Muslim World League, who he said used Islamic history to justify the move towards coexistence.\nMoreover, deputy Saudi intelligence chief Maj.-Gen. Ahmed Asiri pointed out in February that both Israel and Riyadh share concerns over Tehran. \u201cWe have the same enemy, the same threat,\u201d WSJ quoted. He also noted the U.S. is an ally of both Israel and Saudi Arabia as well.\nThe simple fact is, every Israeli prime minister since 1973 has presented some version of a final status deal to the Palestinian Authority, including several that included handing over most of Judea and Samaria. Each and every proposal was rejected by every leader of the Palestinian Authority, from Yasser Arafat to Mahmoud Abbas.\nAnd so it has continued to this day, with the PA continuing to refuse to recognize the Jewish state or accept its right to exist within secure borders. The PA continues to incite violence against Israelis, to pay salaries to imprisoned terrorists, to build tunnels into Israel for the purpose of carrying out terror attacks",
        "As we reflect on the lessons learned through the big-data boom, of how organisations securely capture, store and retrieve data and how they can derive value from these huge data sets, we must begin to prepare for a yet another new wave of data.\nThis data will come from millions of new Internet enabled devices, a continued push towards the use of virtualised machines and the adoption of cloud enabled business-critical applications.\nThis volume will make it more important than ever for organisations to holistically manage their data and storage more intelligently, and cloud services will be a key element to achieve this. Although the cloud has been around for a few years now, it is only recently that organisations started to really understand how to leverage it to suit their business needs. More than simply shared hard drives in the sky, today we see an increasing array of enterprise-level cloud services from virtual computers to fully realised Enterprise applications.\nHowever, what are the latest trends and services brought by the cloud and how can organisations now seize the opportunity to leverage on these new functions to enhance their business capabilities.\nWe predict that enterprises, rather than continuing to spend capital in their own datacenters, will become increasingly comfortable utilising big public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Dimension Data and RackSpace. The cloud is becoming more adept at allowing the use of data-intensive applications, e.g. SharePoint, Oracle or SAP. Currently, most organisations are knowledgeable about all of the different cloud service models \u2013 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) \u2013 but are still unsure which model best suits their business needs.\nEnterprises are beginning to recognise the benefits",

He was shot a year later by a Nationalist firing squad.\nIn the Andalusian city of Granada, a little road leads uphill, past the forested ramparts of the Alhambra, to a cemetery. The earth there is a deep, raw red, and the olive trees that punctuate it are green and gray and very old. The cemetery wall is high and long, the same color as the earth, and it is crowned with rough clay tiles.\nTwenty feet or so along the wall from its southwestern corner, there are egg-size gouges in the plastered brick. The marks are impacts from bullets. In the summer of 1936, more than a thousand people were brought to the cemetery in open trucks, day after day, to be shot against the wall by firing squads. American tourists who were staying in the little hotels down the lane later told of their horror at being awakened before dawn by the grinding gears of the trucks as they went uphill, and then, minutes later, hearing the volleys of gunfire. On August 16th, thirty people were shot at the cemetery, while down in the city the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca was taken into custody. Two days later, Lorca was murdered, along with two bullfighters and a schoolteacher.\nLorca was handsome and dark-haired, and walked with a curious, flat-footed gait that made him instantly recognizable on the streets of Granada. He had been born in nearby Fuente Vaqueros in 1898, but he had spent his adult life in Madrid, where he had written some of the most celebrated poems and plays in modern Spanish literature.",

Having escaped the city rut, sipping coffee felt like one had recalibrated the mind, very refreshing.

Literally in the lap of the snow-capped Panchchuli peaks, I had seen a picture a photographer friend had clicked a couple of years ago. And boy! going by the photo, it looked spectacular and picture perfect. It had been my intent to drive up to this paradise for some time now, and finally I was on the road and the time had come.

Find it wherever books are sold 4/17/2018.\nSome of my favorite books in the history of Star Wars have been the triple shots of adventures starring Lando Calrissian and Han Solo, published in the late 1970s and early 1980s. With Solo getting written by Brian Daley and Calrissian written by L. Neil Smith, the books were short, fun, and had an adventurous vibe that maybe some of the other more serious books in the canon lacked.\nIt's been a while since we've had a book like that.\nDaniel Jos\u00e9 Older gives it to us in spades. This novel is split into three different timelines for our heroes. The timeline that dates the furthest back belongs to Lando and his droid L3-37 and evokes all of the same spirit as the original Lando books. L3 even feels very much like Vuffi Raa at times, Lando's droid companion in those. She's a droid concerned with things other droids typically aren't and might even be something else entirely. The middle chapter involves Han Solo after he took possession of the Falcon. He's with Chewie, naturally, getting in over his head with Sana Starros and a bizarre job. The final chapter takes place just before the events of The Force Awakens and has both Lando and Han teaming up once again.\nEach story stands on its own quite well, but together they form a cohesive whole that makes you feel like these characters",
        "This weekend the Texas Legislature approved HB 2741, a vehicle licensing bill that included a provision to increase penalties on trucks that are hauling overweight loads on our roadways. The House voted 135-9 to approve this measure after differences between House and Senate versions of the bill were ironed out in a conference committee. The Senate approved the measure as well, but the recorded vote is not available as of this publication. All that is missing now for our roadways to become a little bit safer is for Governor Rick Perry to apply his signature.\nCurrently the law on overloading trucks is hardly even a slight deterrent to those who wish to cheat the system to gain an unfair business advantage by carrying overweight loads. The average fine for violation of existing law is less than what you and I would pay for a speeding ticket - about $150. Under the new law, there is a sliding scale of penalties that range up to $10,000 for the first offense. These fines are doubled on the 3rd offense. The bill also includes fines for trucking companies with repeat offenses, and in some cases, for shippers who are demanding heavy loads be carried.\nOverloaded trucks are destroying roadways in Texas at a record rate. Roads that are designed to last twenty to thirty years are being turned to rubble in five to ten years. In addition to the huge maintenance expense, these damaged roads are a massive safety hazard causing damage to other vehicles, accidents and even fatalities.\nThe Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has been working hard over the past few months to get this legislation passed. They have made it very clear that they need help from all Texans to get this done. TxDOT Director Phil Wilson testified before",

No one warned me that I was actually travelling there in a time machine, back to an age when girls were girls and men were men. It soon became obvious.\nWhat I learned in the few years I worked in the nation's capital was that power and privilege allow for the most boorish behaviour imaginable. And before anyone suggests that I'm talking about the olden days, gather round and I'll tell you stories that seem all too familiar today.\nSeasoned veterans of the Parliamentary Press Gallery had advised me not to rely too much on Question Period or news conferences but to get out into the bump and grind of the Ottawa social circuit and make connections. I was chuffed when a senior member of prime minister Brian Mulroney's inner cabinet circle, a popular senator, invited me to a \"5 to 7\" reception at his Ottawa pied-\u00e0-terre (I'm not naming him because he's deceased and unable to respond to this story).\nI don't recall the purpose of the soiree, but I do remember being ushered into a small sitting room where I found myself face-to-face with three men. The man who had invited me was standing between two others, both of whom were staring at me intently.\n\"",
        "An insight into the effect of global warming in the Antarctic is revealed in a report behind a new exhibition at the Australian National Maritime Museum.\nThe preliminary report into an expedition led by scientists from the Australian Antarctic Division and the Boston Oceanographic Institute suggests significant changes are occurring at the lowest level of the food chain, which is a vital source of sustenance for seabirds, seals and whales.\nData from the expedition in 2010 is still being collated, but a selection from the 20,000 images to be used as a reference point for monitoring future change will go on show in Sydney from next Saturday.\nOf observations made at Cuverille Island, the report notes: ''Another interesting feature of the island is the presence of two plants, a moss and a grass, crucial indicators of warming weather. Warming is evident in the moistness of the air in this area of the world's driest continent.\n''Rain is now not uncommon and whilst this may encourage plant life, it is probably detrimental to the health of many breeding birds, which get damp and cold.\n''This moistness also results in more snow falling and this too can affect the breeding habits of nesting birds when it falls during their incubation period, burying their eggs in the cold snow.\n''At Peterman Island we saw penguins soaked by the rain, and this is a location where the more northern gentoo penguins are increasing in numbers at the expense of the Adelies [emperor penguins], which prefer drier conditions.''\nWhile there is no doubt that climate change is having an impact on Antarctica, it is impossible to say how much is caused by human-induced global warming or by natural climatic fluctuations.\nBut the report",

For some time, the keyboard was restricted to simply the word processor and the computer. It took a while for mobile devices to take advantage of the QWERTY keyboard style on handsets.\nHowever, innovative technologies allow a wider breadth of input into computers and mobile devices. But even with touch technology, arguably spurred on by tablets and touch-screen phones like the iPad and iPhone, the keyboard still reigns as the most natural and innate input device for all to use.\nWhen the technology was founded: Microsoft Office was first released in fall 1990 for Windows 3.0.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: Without doubt, Microsoft Office is one of the most used, and understandably the most expensive office and productivity suite of programs on the market. Because of its userbase in the hundreds of millions, ranging from large corporations to governments, it is almost as widely used as Windows itself.\nBut the one thing that hinders it the most is that bar the Office:mac edition, it only runs on the Windows platform.

In this Rewind Review, we journey back to 2008 to take a look at the best of the bunch, The Dark Knight.\nThe Dark Knight is the follow-up to Batman Begins (2005), and sees billionaire Bruce Wayne continuing his fight against the criminal underworld as masked vigilante, Batman. But nothing can prepare him for the rise of the Joker, an unstable force of nature that pushes Batman towards confronting the consequences of his actions.\nCo-written by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, the movie plays out like a crime thriller, rather than a superhero film, with Batman attempting to thwart a psychopathic terrorist in clown makeup that knows exactly which buttons to press.\nChristian Bale returns as the Dark Knight and continues his brilliant performance to near perfection. He manages to bring all three of Bruce\u2019s personalities a sense of realism, whether that\u2019s as Bruce Wayne in the public, the real Bruce with Alfred, and of course, Batman himself.\nThis time around, Bale brings gets to explore a more fragile side to the character, stepping away from the anger of Batman Begins.

Here\u2019s what he had to say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nBARACK OBAMA, US PRESIDENT: The United States believes that negotiations should result in two states with permanent Palestinian borders with Israel, Jordan, and Egypt and permanent Israeli borders with Palestine. We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states. The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves and reach their full potential in a sovereign and contiguous state. As for security, every state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat. Provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism, to stop the infiltration of weapons, and to provide effective border security. The full and phased withdrawal of Israeli military forces should be coordinated with the assumption of Palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign, non-militarized state.\nJAY: Now joining us from Ramallah, Palestine, to give his views on President Obama\u2019s speech is Omar Barghouti.

The team also plans to use the camera with a lure consisting of an electronic jellyfish which mimics the various bioluminescent light patterns given off by its real counterpart.\n\"We are hoping to do some honest to goodness unobtrusive observation, which really hasn't happened in the ocean,\" said Widder. \"Ultimately the goal is to see animals or behaviours nobody has ever seen before.\"\nAlthough the deep sea makes up about 78% of the planet's inhabitable volume, little is known about most of its inhabitants - more than half of which are capable of making their own light, or bioluminescence. This is in part because traditional research methods, such as deep-towed nets, can damage animals making their natural behaviours impossible to observe in the lab. Vehicles can deliver humans deep down, but typically ther lights, motors and electric fields scare animals away or frighten them into unnatural behaviour.\nIt was for these reasons Widder helped create the new unobtrusive camera system called the \"Eye in the Sea\". The system operates automatically on the sea floor at depths between 100m and 1000m (330ft-3300ft). It consists of two parts: a small video camera equipped with an infrared flash that does not interfere with biolum",

Aereo uses a tiny HD antenna the size of a dime to pick up the broadcast signal for each of its users, which for now allows it to operate legally. Aereo also provides a DVR feature that lets you record up to 40 hours of content.\nPreviously, Aereo was only available to residents of New York City, but soon it will be available in several cities across the country, including Boston, Miami, Austin, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Washington DC, Baltimore, Detroit, Denver, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Tampa, Cleveland, Kansas City, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City, Birmingham (Ala.), Providence (R.I.), and Madison (Wis.).\nThe expansion will start this spring in the warmer cities and continue through the end of 2013. (The company said it\u2019ll take nearly two months to get the service up and running for beta testing.) These cities represent the first phase of growth for the service, which will eventually roll out in more areas across the country.\nInitially, Aereo will offer access through a beta version of the service, which you can sign up for today on its website. The final product will cost $8 per month, with no contracts or hidden fees.\n\u201cWe have been overwhelmed by the positive response we have received from consumers since we began our beta program last year,\u201d Aereo CEO and founder Chet Kanojia",
        "AUSTIN \u2014 Rep. Rafael Anchia filed a resolution Monday condemning President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel to the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.\nAnchia, a Democrat from Dallas, described the move as \"unconstitutional, un-American, unwise and unorganized.\"\n\"This was not well thought out,\" Anchia said. \"It was developed without consultation of the folks that are supposed to keep us safe, and the president really messed this up, and he needs to pull it down. The Legislature of the state of Texas needs to demand that he do so.\"\nTrump's order bans Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely and creates a 90-day travel ban for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump also suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days.\nAnchia's resolution calls the move \"an open act of discrimination against Muslims\" and says the Texas House stands by \"our moral oaths to respect the rule of law and love our neighbors.\"\nA federal judge issued a temporary stay Saturday that prevented the government from deporting people under the ban, but the judge's order did not apply to people traveling to the United States. A number of travelers were detained at airports across the country on Saturday.\nTrump denies that his executive order is a Muslim ban and said Sunday that the country \"will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and residents.\"\nAnchia said he plans to file an identical resolution in the Texas Senate. He said he believes there is enough bipartisan support in both chambers to pass the measure.\nHouse Speaker",

        "Medicaid expansion in Michigan has paid off handsomely for most of the state's 14 Medicaid HMOs.\nThe three biggest Medicaid HMOs in Michigan \u2014 for-profits Meridian Health Plan of Michigan, Molina Healthcare of Michigan and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan \u2014 increased underwriting income to record levels, despite experiencing double-digit average increases in medical expense costs and a bump in administrative expenses, according to an analysis of Michigan financial data by Minneapolis-based consultant Allan Baumgarten.\nMolina Healthcare recorded $82 million in underwriting income last year for a 6.7 percent margin, and Meridian notched $27 million in underwriting income for a 1.3 percent margin, according to financial data filed to the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services.\nMolina of Michigan is owned by Molina Healthcare of Long Beach, Calif., which operates Medicaid plans in 11 states, including Illinois and Ohio. Meridian is a family-owned plan based in Detroit that runs Medicaid and Medicare plans in six states.\nUnitedHealthcare Community recorded $79.1 million in underwriting income, a 65 percent increase from $47.9 million in 2014. The Southfield-based plan, which is owned by the nation's largest HMO, Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealthcare Group Inc., lost $8.7 million in 2013, the year before Healthy Michigan Medicaid expansion began in April 2014.\nPriority Health and Blue Care Network of Michigan, both nonprofit HMOs owned by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, also benefited from Medicaid expansion, although their margins were lower than those of Meridian, Molina and UnitedHealthcare Community. Priority Health had a 1.1",
        "B OFFENSIVE LINE: The running lanes weren\u2019t as wide as they were against New Orleans, but the absence of Cam Newton played a big part in that. Anderson was sacked three times, but one came on a scramble when he was stopped for no gain. Continuity is helping the front five gain confidence each week.\nA DEFENSIVE LINE: Ends Charles Johnson and Mario Addison changed the course of the game when they combined for a sack of Josh McCown on the Bucs\u2019 first possession of the second half. Addison\u2019s strip of McCown was recovered by defensive tackle Kawann Short and gave the Panthers the ball at the Tampa Bay 4. Johnson has turned up his game the past few weeks.\nC LINEBACKERS: Luke Kuechly (six tackles) and Thomas Davis (four) finished with season lows in tackles, although Kuechly ended Tampa Bay\u2019s comeback hopes with an interception. Both were sealed off on Doug Martin\u2019s 63-yard run on the Bucs\u2019 second offensive snap. Davis hyperextended his left knee in the second half \u2013 not the knee that has undergone three ACL surgeries.\nB DEFENSIVE BACKS: Cornerback Josh Norman was upset about giving up Mike Evans\u2019 8-yard touchdown catch in the first half. Norman was in good position, but the 6-foot-6 Evans went up over him to make the catch. Rookie safety Tre Boston tied Kuechly for the team high with six tackles.\nB SPECIAL TEAMS: Graham Gano made all four of his field-goal attempts, including a 51-yarder in the third quarter.

        "\"If wishes were horses, beggars might ride.\" A Texas judge and a urologist ventured into uncharted territory recently when they agreed to harvesting sperm from a dead man.\n\"If wishes were horses, beggars might ride.\"\nA Texas judge and a urologist ventured into uncharted territory recently when they agreed to harvesting sperm from a dead man.\nIt wasn't Nikolas Evans' bereaved widow who asked for the sperm. Evans was not married. His mother, Missy Evans, pleaded with a Travis County probate judge because, she said, her 21-year-old son once said he wanted children. Three sons, in fact.\nWell, plenty of us would like to keep getting money from the tooth fairy, but real life typically intervenes when we grow up. Nikolas, 21, was punched in a street fight in Austin on March 27 and fell to the ground, striking his head. He died April 5. His death is a shame, but it's also a fact. Collecting his sperm won't bring him back, but it opens up a Pandora's box of ethical and practical questions.\nSomehow Missy Evans convinced the judge to order the county Medical Examiner's Office to keep Nikolas' body properly chilled and to allow an expert to remove the sperm, then found a urologist to collect it. She's been told much of the sperm is viable.\nSo ... the prospective father is dead. Who will be the mother?\nMissy Evans says she has identified three women who are interested in donating their eggs. The resulting embryos will be frozen until someone comes along who wants them implanted.\nBut that's where things get dicey. The",
        "The Queensland Government has known for more than two years that the site where it proposes to dump millions of tonnes of dredge spoil at Abbot Point was the worst of seven possible options for port expansion from an environmental point of view.\nExperts working for North Queensland Bulk Ports, a government-owned corporation which operates the Abbot Point terminal, reported in September 2012 that the site west of the port where the State Government now proposes to dump the spoils offered the lowest cost option for reclamation and expansion and was nearest to the coast.\nBut the consultants warned: \"However, the West Site is considered the least desirable from an environmental and approvals perspective as it will result in the greatest impact on the Caley Valley Wetland and Cultural Heritage values of Abbot Point\".\nThe reports, not previously made public and obtained under Right To Information, show experts considered the risks of expansion on the western site were so high it was in any case highly unlikely it would obtain Commonwealth approval.\nEngineers Aurecon reported in September 2012 under the heading of \"Approval Risk\": \"Approval and potential delay risk high due to loss of wetland area and resulting impacts to wetland species [migratory birds etc].\"\nAnd environmental experts E3 Consult warned of \"intense scrutiny from community and environmental groups\" of such a plan and predicted: \"The likelihood of not gaining an approval is very high. Should an approval be granted by the Commonwealth Minister, it is highly likely to be appealed, which could delay the commencement of the project.\"\nThe report also said: \"It should be noted that there is significant opposition from the local community (including the Bowen Shire Council) and environmental groups to the use of the West Site for port development. The proponents should be aware that",
        "Consumers will pay the highest Fourth of July gasoline prices in six years, but pump prices would be far higher if not for dramatic changes in the U.S. oil industry.\nBoth the production and refining sides of the industry are contributing to a better supply environment, thanks to the oil shale boom and significant expansion of the U.S. refining industry in the last several years.\nPrices are expected to go lower this summer, and by Labor Day could be 7 cents to 12 cents cheaper per gallon than the current national average of $3.67 per gallon.\n\"Without hurricanes, I would say Labor Day, I would be looking at something in the $3.55 to $3.60 neighborhood. I think the real decline always occurs in the last 100 days of the year,\" said Tom Kloza, oil analyst with GasBuddy.com.\nU.S. refining capacity\u201417.9 million barrels\u2014is at the highest level it's been in 33 years, when it was briefly more than 18 million barrels. For a nation that was once concerned about a lack of new refineries, the industry has been expanding existing facilities, adding more than 2 million barrels a day capacity since the late 1990s.\n\"It's the highest since 1981. That says to me rather than building new refineries, we've just expanded existing ones to get the most out of them,\" said John Kilduff, founder of Again Capital, a New York-based energy hedge fund.\nBut perhaps the biggest contributor to lower gasoline prices has been the rise of domestic oil production, which is now at its highest level",
        "Gaza is a coastal strip of land that lay on ancient trading and maritime routes along the Mediterranean shore.\nHeld by the Ottoman Empire until 1917, it passed from British to Egyptian to Israeli military rule over the last century and is now a fenced-in enclave inhabited by two million Palestinians.\nTens of thousands of Palestinians took refuge in Gaza after fleeing or being driven from their homes. The invading Egyptian army had seized a narrow coastal strip 25 miles (40 km) long from the Sinai to just south of Ashkelon. The influx of refugees saw Gaza's population triple to around 200,000.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s armed Palestinian 'fedayeen' - many of them refugees - mounted attacks into Israel, drawing reprisals. The United Nations set up a refugee agency, UNRWA, which today provides services for 1.3 million registered Palestine refugees in Gaza, around 70 per cent of the population, as well as for Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank.\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. An Israeli census that year put Gaza's population at 394,000, at least 60 percent of them refugees. It found that 65 percent of working-age men in the 145 sq. mile (375 sq. km) territory were unemployed.\nThe Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), signed in Washington in September 1993, envisaged Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and parts of the West Bank.\n",
        "The will-she-or-won\u2019t-she question on Clinton\u2019s turn to the left.\nSenator Bernie Sanders is drawing crowds of thousands at campaign events and gaining momentum at a pace that suggests there is a real Democratic hunger for more populist and progressive\u2014or, as Sanders calls himself, \u201cDemocratic socialist\u201d\u2014policies. That means Hillary Clinton, long presumed to be the front-runner in the fight for the Democratic nomination for president, needs to sharpen her rhetoric on regulation and income inequality.\nDespite sounding an increasingly populist note during her campaign, Clinton is hardly known as a foe of the financial industry. She has given many lucrative speeches at the likes of Goldman Sachs, and her early denouncements of hedge funds and big banks were met with amusement and rolled eyes on the Street.\nSome on Wall Street think powerful populist pitches from former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley and Sanders, coupled with the heavy influence of noncandidate Elizabeth Warren, could force Clinton to come out harder on issues including breaking up the nation\u2019s largest banks, imposing a financial transaction tax, putting individual bankers in jail, cracking down on executive pay, and otherwise beating up on an industry that six years after the financial crisis still suffers from rock-bottom public-opinion ratings.\nClinton is expected to continue to ratchet up the tone she debuted during her \u201clistening tour\u201d of Iowa, when the candidate bemoaned the influence of money in politics and said that low-income truck drivers shouldn\u2019t pay more in taxes than billionaires like Donald Trump.\n\u201cI am concerned about what I see happening in our country,\u201d Clinton told the Des Moines Register editorial board earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the middle class and whether it can sustain itself.\u201d",
        "While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained mainstream notoriety, it remains unlikely any Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) will appear on the New York Stock Exchange any time soon.\nThat prediction comes from Tom Farley, the president of NYSE Group that oversees the New York Stock Exchange. While speaking with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Farley said Bitcoin ETFs still have a ways to go before clearing the necessary regulatory hurdles.\nThere have been a number of efforts to get a Bitcoin ETF off the ground, along with gain similar acceptance for other cryptocurrencies but none of the attempts have proven successful thus far, falling short of gaining approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nPerhaps the most notable failure thus far was the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, backed by twin entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook fame. The effort was rejected by the commission after it found the proposed fund was susceptible to fraud due to the digital currency\u2019s unregulated nature.\nThe concept behind the Winklevoss ETF and others like it is to create a stock fund tied to the price of Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), which would allow investors to purchase the currency without holding it directly. The fund would work in the same way that a person can investment money into another commodity like gold.\nETFs would have helped lower the barrier of entry that comes with the cryptocurrency, which can require some technical know-how. Currently, acquiring cryptocurrency requires people to set up an account with a digital wallet and then buy the coins through a third party like Coinbase or Kraken.\nFarley said he believes the SEC has good reason to be cautious about approving such funds.\n\u201cI think there are legitimate concerns around",
